    The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you want to learn how to write your documents with LaTeX,
    this introduction is for you. It is not about setting up a
    LaTeX system. While it is not as comprehensive as Lamport's book,   
    it should be sufficient in most cases.

    To print the document, there are several possibilities:

    a) Copy one of the ps files to your printer:
          
              lshort.ps  
              lshort-book.ps  A4/booklet/duplex
       
       NOTE for Abt IIIB: you can print the booklet version to
       the VPP printer with 

  	  vpp -dest=etzj61 lshort-book.ps
	or
	  vpp -dest=etzd96 lshort-book.ps

    b) Print the lshort.dvi file with a dvi-driver. (You need to 
       have the AMS math fonts installed your system. If you don't,
       your dvi-driver will complain.)

    c) Rebuild the whole document from scratch by LaTeXing
       lshort.tex. (If you don't have the AMS classes installed, the
       relevant parts of the document will be left out, but it
       will format without problem. After latexing the document twice, 
       you should use makeindex to generate a new index file.

       (to get the adobe euro symbol right you need to install the 
        ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/type/win/all/eurofont.exe as described in
        http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/euro/latex/europs/README.europs)

    The preformatted versions of the document are set for double sided
    printing on A4 paper. If you want a single sided version, you need to
    replace "twoside" by "oneside" in the parameters list of the
    \documentclass command in lshort.tex. To produce a small booklet (A5)
    you can use the pre generated ps file of you can use your dvi-driver to
    shrink the output and then use pstops to paste the resulting pages
    together in the right order.

    To produce a A5 Booklet from source, I recommend the following procedure, 
    on the twoside lshort2e.dvi:

    *) dvips -x800 -P?? -olshort.ps lshort.dvi
       (?? is the name of the printer you want to print the booklet)

    *) psbook lshort.ps out.ps

    *) pstops "4:0L(27.8cm,-1.5cm)+1L(27.8cm,13.3cm)" out.ps p1.ps
       (p1.ps now contains the front pages)
 
    *) pstops "4:2L(27.8cm,-1.5cm)+3L(27.8cm,13.3cm)" out.ps p2.ps 
       (p2.ps contains the back pages)

    If have a doublex(shoprtbind) Printer:

    *) pstops "4:0L(27.8cm,-1.5cm)+1L(27.8cm,13.3cm),2L(27.8cm,-1.5cm)+3L(27.8cm,13.3cm)" out.ps lshort-book.ps

    If you have postscript versions of the latex Fonts you can use
    (make sure your printer has enough memmory for this)

    *) dvips -Pcmz -olshort.ps lshort.dvi
    *) psbook lshort.ps out.ps
    *) pstops "4:0L@0.8(22.76cm,-0.6cm)+1L@0.8(22.76cm,13.45cm),3R@0.8(-1.38cm,16.25cm)+2R@0.8(-1.38cm,30.3cm)" out.ps lshort-book.ps
