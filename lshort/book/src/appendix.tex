\chapter{Installing \LaTeX}
\begin{intro}
Knuth published the source to \TeX{} back in a time when nobody knew
about OpenSource and/or Free Software. The License that comes with \TeX{}
lets you do whatever you want with the source, but you can only call the
result of your work \TeX{} if the program passes a set of tests Knuth has
also provided. This has lead to a situation where we have free \TeX{}
implementations for almost every Operating System under the Sun. In this chapter
you will give some hints on what to install on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows to
get \TeX{} working.
\end{intro}

\section{What to Install}

For using LaTeX on any computer system, you need several programs.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} program for processing your \LaTeX{} source files
into typeset PDF or DVI documents.

\item A text editor for editing your LaTeX source files. Some products even let
you start the latex program from within the editor.

\item A PDF/DVI viewer program for previewing and printing your
documents.

\item A program to handle \PSi{} files and images for inclusion into
your documents.

\end{enumerate}

For all platforms there are many programs that fit the requirements above.
Here we just tell about the ones we know, like and have some experience
with.

\section{\TeX{} on Mac OS X}

\subsection{Get a \TeX{} Distribution}

Just download \wi{MacTeX}. It is a
pre-compiled LaTeX distribution for OS X. \wi{MacTeX} provides a full LaTeX
installation plus a number of additional tools. Get MaxTeX from
\url{http://www.tug.org/mactex/}.

If you are already using Macports or Fink for installing Unix software under
OS X, install LaTeX using these package managers. Macport users install
LaTeX with \framebox{\texttt{port install texlive}},
Fink users use the command \framebox{\texttt{fink install texlive}}.

\subsection{Picking an Editor}

The most popular open source editor for \LaTeX{} on the mac seems to be
\TeX{}shop.  Get a copy from \url{http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop}. It
is also contained in the \wi{MacTeX} distribution.

Another fine editor is Texmaker. Apart from being a useful editor it has the
advantage of running on Windows, Mac and Unix/Linux equally well. Go to
\url{http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker} for further Information. Note there is
also a forked version of Texmaker called TexmakerX on
\url{http://texmakerx.sourceforge.net/} it promises additional functionality.

Recent \TeX Live distributions contain the \TeX{}works editor 
\url{http://texworks.org/} which is a multi-platform editor based on the \TeX{}Shop
design. Since \TeX{}works uses the Qt toolkit, it is available on any platform
supported by this toolkit (MacOS X, Windows, Linux.) 

\subsection{Treat yourself to \wi{PDFView}}

Use PDFView for viewing PDF files generated by LaTeX, it integrates tightly
with your LaTeX text editor. PDFView is an open-source application can be
downloaded from the PDFView website on\\
\url{http://pdfview.sourceforge.net/}. Download and install PDFView. Open
PDFViews preferences dialog and make sure that the \emph{automatically reload
documents} option is enabled and that PDFSync support is set to the TextMate
preset.

\section{\TeX{} on Windows}

\subsection{Getting \TeX{}}

First, get a copy of the excellent MiK\TeX\index{MiKTeX@MiK\TeX} distribution from\\
\url{http://www.miktex.org/}. It contains all the basic programs and files
required to compile \LaTeX{} documents.  The coolest feature in my eyes, is
that MiKTeX will download missing \LaTeX{} packages on the fly and install them
magically while compiling a document. Alternatively you can also use
the TeXlive distribution which exists for Windows, Unix and Mac OS to
get your base setup going \url{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}.

\subsection{A \LaTeX{} editor}

\LaTeX{} is a programming language for text documents. \wi{TeXnicCenter}
uses many concepts from the programming-world to provide a nice and
efficient \LaTeX{} writing environment in Windows. Get your copy from\\
\url{http://http://www.texniccenter.org/}. TeXnicCenter integrates nicely with
MiKTeX. Version 2.0 of TeXnicCenter will support Unicode, the recent alpha version
seems to be quite stable.

Other excellent choice is the editor provided by the LEd project available
on \url{http://www.latexeditor.org}.

See the note on Texmaker in the Mac section above for a third choice.

Recent \TeX Live distributions contain the \TeX{}works Editor
\url{http://texworks.org/}. It supports Unicode and requires at least Windows XP.

\subsection{Document Preview}

You will most likely be using Yap for DVI preview as it gets installed with
MikTeX. For PDF you may want to look at Sumatra
PDF \url{http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/}. I mention Sumatra PDF
because it lets you jump from any position in the pdf document back into
corresponding position in your source document.

\subsection{Working with graphics}

Working with high quality graphics in \LaTeX{} means that you have to use
\EPSi{} (eps) or PDF as your picture format. The program that helps you
deal with this is called \wi{GhostScript}. You can get it, together with its
own front-end \wi{GhostView}, from \url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/}.

If you deal with bitmap graphics (photos and scanned material), you may want
to have a look at the open source photoshop alternative \wi{Gimp} available
from \url{http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/}.

\section{\TeX{} on Linux}

If you work with Linux, chances are high that \LaTeX{} is already installed
on your system, or at least available on the installation source you used to
setup. Use your package manager to install the following packages:

\begin{itemize}
\item texlive -- the base \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} setup.
\item emacs (with auctex) -- a Linux editor that integrates tightly with \LaTeX{} through the add-on AucTeX package.
\item ghostscript -- a \PSi{} preview program.
\item xpdf and acrobat -- a PDF preview program.
\item imagemagick -- a free program for converting bitmap images.
\item gimp -- a free photoshop look-a-like.
\item inkscape -- a free illustrator/corel draw look-a-like.
\end{itemize}

If you are looking for a more windows like graphical editing environment,
check out Texmaker or \TeX{}works. See the note in the Mac section above.

Most Linux distros insist on splitting up their \TeX{} environments into a
large number of optional packages, so if something is missing after your
first install, go check again.
