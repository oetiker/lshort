\chapter{Installing \LaTeX}
\begin{intro}
Knuth published the source to \TeX{} back in a time when nobody knew
about OpenSource and/or Free Software. The License that comes with \TeX{}
lets you do whatever you want with the source, but you can only call the
result of your work \TeX{} if the program passes a set of tests Knuth has
also provided. This has lead to a situation where we have free \TeX{}
implementations for almost every Operating System under the sun. This chapter
will give some hints on what to install on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, to
get a working \TeX{} setup.
\end{intro}

\section{What to Install}

To use \LaTeX{} on any computer system, you need several programs.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} program for processing your \LaTeX{} source files
into typeset PDF or DVI documents.

\item A text editor for editing your \LaTeX{} source files. Some products even let
you start the \LaTeX{} program from within the editor.

\item A PDF/DVI viewer program for previewing and printing your
documents.

\item A program to handle \PSi{} files and images for inclusion into
your documents.

\end{enumerate}

For every platforms there are several programs that fit the requirements above.
Here we just tell about the ones we know, like and have some experience
with.

\section{Cross Platform Editor}
\label{sec:texmaker}

While \TeX{} is available on many different computing platforms, \LaTeX{}
editors have long been highly platform specific.

Over the past few years I have come to like Texmaker quite a lot.
Apart from being very a useful editor with integrated pdf-preview and syntax
high-lighting, it has the advantage of running on Windows, Mac and
Unix/Linux equally well.  See \url{http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker} for
further information.  There is also a forked version of Texmaker called
TeXstudio on \url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/}.  It also seems well
maintained and is also available for all three major platforms.

You will find some platform specific editor suggestions in the OS sections
below.

\section{\TeX{} on Mac OS X}

\subsection{\TeX{} Distribution}

Just download \wi{MacTeX}. It is a
pre-compiled \LaTeX{} distribution for OS X. \wi{MacTeX} provides a full \LaTeX{}
installation plus a number of additional tools. Get Mac\TeX{} from
\url{http://www.tug.org/mactex/}.

\subsection{OSX \TeX{} Editor}

If you are not happy with our crossplatform suggestion Texmaker (section \ref{sec:texmaker}).
 
The most popular open source editor for \LaTeX{} on the mac seems to be
\TeX{}shop.  Get a copy from \url{http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop}. It
is also contained in the \wi{MacTeX} distribution.

Recent \TeX Live distributions contain the \TeX{}works editor 
\url{http://texworks.org/} which is a multi-platform editor based on the \TeX{}Shop
design. Since \TeX{}works uses the Qt toolkit, it is available on any platform
supported by this toolkit (MacOS X, Windows, Linux.) 

\subsection{Treat yourself to \wi{PDFView}}

Use PDFView for viewing PDF files generated by \LaTeX{}, it integrates tightly
with your \LaTeX{} text editor. PDFView is an open-source application, available from the PDFView website on\\
\url{http://pdfview.sourceforge.net/}. After installing, open
PDFViews preferences dialog and make sure that the \emph{automatically reload
documents} option is enabled and that PDFSync support is set appropriately.

\section{\TeX{} on Windows}

\subsection{Getting \TeX{}}

First, get a copy of the excellent MiK\TeX\index{MiKTeX@MiK\TeX} distribution from\\
\url{http://www.miktex.org/}. It contains all the basic programs and files
required to compile \LaTeX{} documents.  The coolest feature in my eyes, is
that MiK\TeX{} will download missing \LaTeX{} packages on the fly and install them
magically while compiling a document. Alternatively you can also use
the TeXlive distribution which exists for Windows, Unix and Mac OS to
get your base setup going \url{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}.

\subsection{A \LaTeX{} editor}

If you are not happy with our crossplatform suggestion Texmaker (section \ref{sec:texmaker}).

\wi{TeXnicCenter} uses many concepts from the programming-world to provide a nice and
efficient \LaTeX{} writing environment in Windows. Get your copy from\\
\url{http://www.texniccenter.org/}. TeXnicCenter integrates nicely with
MiKTeX.

Recent \TeX Live distributions contain the \TeX{}works Editor
\url{http://texworks.org/}. It supports Unicode and requires at least Windows XP.

\subsection{Document Preview}

You will most likely be using Yap for DVI preview as it gets installed with
MikTeX. For PDF you may want to look at Sumatra
PDF \url{http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/}. I mention Sumatra PDF
because it lets you jump from any position in the pdf document back into
corresponding position in your source document.

\subsection{Working with graphics}

Working with high quality graphics in \LaTeX{} means that you have to use
\EPSi{} (eps) or PDF as your picture format. The program that helps you
deal with this is called \wi{GhostScript}. You can get it, together with its
own front-end \wi{GhostView}, from \url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/}.

If you deal with bitmap graphics (photos and scanned material), you may want
to have a look at the open source Photoshop alternative \wi{Gimp}, available
from \url{http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/}.

\section{\TeX{} on Linux}

If you work with Linux, chances are high that \LaTeX{} is already installed
on your system, or at least available on the installation source you used to
setup. Use your package manager to install the following packages:

\begin{itemize}
\item texlive -- the base \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} setup.
\item emacs (with AUCTeX) -- an editor that integrates tightly with \LaTeX{} through the add-on AUCTeX package.
\item ghostscript -- a \PSi{} preview program.
\item xpdf and acrobat -- a PDF preview program.
\item imagemagick -- a free program for converting bitmap images.
\item gimp -- a free Photoshop look-a-like.
\item inkscape -- a free illustrator/corel draw look-a-like.
\end{itemize}

If you are looking for a more windows like graphical editing environment,
check out Texmaker. See section \ref{sec:texmaker}.

Most Linux distros insist on splitting up their \TeX{} environments into a
large number of optional packages, so if something is missing after your
first install, go check again.
