\chapter{Typesetting Mathematical Formulae}\label{chap:math}

\begin{intro}
  The \TeX{} typesetting system has become nearly ubiquitous when it comes to
  typesetting mathematics. Many projects offer to export its mathematical
  formulae to \LaTeX{} (for example SageMath~\cite{sagemath}) or allow to enter
  them in \LaTeX{} or \LaTeX{}-derived syntax (for example
  Wikipedia~\cite{enwiki:1091087776}). In this chapter you will learn how to
  insert math formulae into your document.
\end{intro}

\section{Modern Mathematics}

While core \LaTeX{} is able to produce high quality mathematics output on its
own, there are some are areas where it is lacking and some of its choices are
rather dated. To overcome these limitations we are going to use two packages:
\pai*{mathtools} and \pai*{unicode-math}.

The \pai*{amsmath} from the \hologo{AmSLaTeX} bundle was originally developed
by The \emph{\wi{American Mathematical Society}} in 1995 to use for their own
publications, but became pretty much indispensable for typesetting any advanced
mathematics in \LaTeX. It extends the command set to easily typeset matrices,
declare custom operators and much more. However the problem with it becoming so
ubiquitous is that changing it would break a lot of old documents, which is
highly undesirable. Fortunately, the \pai{mathtools} package exists---it loads
the \pai{amsmath} fixing some of its undesirable behaviours and provides some
additional commands.

The original \TeX{} used its own font encoding for typesetting mathematics,
which is still used by default in \LaTeX{}. In recent years a new standard
appeared: OpenType math extensions\footnote{Its internal structure is actually
  based on \TeX{} font tables.} which makes it possible to use standardised
Unicode characters inside documents. The \pai{unicode-math} package adds
support for these fonts in \LaTeX{} allowing you to use more symbols and makes
the commands for accessing math symbols a bit more consistent. The problem with
\pai{unicode-math} is the opposite of the \pai{amsmath}---it is a relatively
new player in the game and it changes some of the fundamental \TeX{}
assumptions, so it may not work well with some packages (especially if they're
old). Unfortunately there is no easy way out of this and you may have to give
up either these packages or unicode math fonts.

Throughout this section it is assumed that your preamble contains these two
lines in this order:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage[
  math-style=ISO,
  warnings-off={mathtools-colon, mathtools-overbracket},
]{unicode-math}
\end{minted}
The \cargv{math-style=ISO} key fixes a small inconsistency in original \TeX{}
regarding the shape of uppercase Greek letters. The \cargv{warnings-off} key
disables two warnings about overwriting some \pai{mathtools}
commands.\footnote{These are \csi{overbracket}, \csi{underbracket},
  \csi{coloneq}, \csi{dblcolon}, \csi{coloneqq}, \csi{Coloneqq} and
  \csi{eqqcolon}. Disable this package option and read these warnings if you are
  going to use them.}

\section{Single Equations}\label{sec:single_equations}

\LaTeX{} distinguishes between two styles of typesetting the formulae:
\emph{\wi{text style}} and \emph{\wi{display style}}. The text style is used
typeset inline math in running text, like this \(\sum_{k=0}^\infty
\frac{1}{k}\), while the display style is used to typeset bigger equations on
their own line, like this
\[
  \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k}.
\]

To typeset inline formulae, put it between \csi{(} and \csi{)} commands, while
\csi{[} and \csi{]} typesets it in display mode.
\begin{chktexignore}  
\begin{example}
Not like this 3-1=0,
but like this \(3-1=2\)
or this
\[
  3 - 1 = 2
\]
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

It is often the case that we want to refer to a specific formula or equation in
the book. To make this possible a special \ei{equation} environment exists that
typesets the formula in display mode and adds a number to the right. The
equations can be labelled and refereed to using commands described in
\autoref{sec:crossref}.
\begin{example}
\begin{equation}
  \label{trivial}
  2 + 2 = 4
\end{equation}
The equation~\ref{trivial}
is true.
\end{example}
Two additional commands exist \csi{eqref} and \csi{tag}. The first one is
similar to the \cs{ref} command but encloses its label in parentheses to match
the appearance of the equation label. The second one allows you to customise
the the visible label of the equation.
\begin{example}
\begin{equation}
  \tag{Ingsoc's theorem}
  \label{ingsoc}
  2 + 2 = 5
\end{equation}
The~\eqref{ingsoc} is false.
\end{example}
The starred version, \ei{equation*}, is a synonym of \csi{[}.

\subsection{Math Mode}

The commands and environments mentioned in the previous section enter what's
called \emph{\wi{math mode}}, as opposed to the \emph{text mode} outside them.
There are numerous differences between those. For starters, most of the
whitespaces are ignored in math mode.
\begin{example}
\(123xyz\) is the same as \(
  1 2 3 x y z
\).
\end{example}
The spaces around symbols are derived logically from the mathematical
expressions. We will talk more about those in \autoref{sec:math-spacing}. Since
in math formulae there is no concept of a paragraph leaving empty lines inside
math mode is \emph{not} allowed. Doing so will result in the \enquote{Bad math
  environment delimiter.} error.

Another difference is the fact that all letters are treated as mathematical
variables. This changes their font style to \textit{italic} and changes the
spacing around them.
\begin{example}
Compare office to \(office\).
\end{example}
If you want to typeset normal text within formulae you can use the \csi{text}
command.
\begin{example}
\( 1 + \text{one} = 2\)
\end{example}

Finally, additional commands and syntax become available that allow to typeset
mathematical notation. For example, the \ai{\^{}} and \ai{\_} characters can
now be used to typeset superscript and subscript, respectively.%
\index{subscript}\index{superscript}
\begin{example}
\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \) \\
\( A_x = G_{\text{foo}} \)
\end{example}

\section{Building Blocks of a Mathematical Formulae}

In this section, we describe the most important commands used in mathematical
typesetting. The list of symbols introduced here is far from comprehensive. If
you need some additional symbols be sure to check out~\cite{detexify,
  unicode-math-symbols, latexcomp} since there is a high chance it already
exists.

\subsection{Basic Arithmetic}

You can probably guess how to typeset addition, subtraction and equality based
on the previous examples. To typeset multiplication and division symbols you can
use \csi{times} and \csi{div} commands.
\begin{example}
\( (4 \times 6) \div 3 = 8 \)
\end{example}
If you prefer to use dots for multiplication or slash for division you can use
\csi{cdot} and \csi{divslash}, respectively. To typeset negated equality you can
precede the equal sign with \csi{not}.
\begin{example}
\( (5 \cdot 3) \divslash 2
  \not= 7 \)
\end{example}
Alternatively you can use \csi{neq} which will produce the same result. The
\csi{not} notation is more general in that it works with many more symbols.

To typeset weak inequalities you can use the \csi{leq} (less or equal) and
\csi{geq} (greater or equal) commands. If you prefer slanted versions swap them
for \csi{leqslant} and \csi{geqslant}.
\begin{example}
\( 1 \leq 2 \) vs.\ 
\(1 \leqslant 2\)
\end{example}

Exponentiation can be achieved using the superscript \ai{\^{}}\index{exponent}
character, but there are some subtleties. During typesetting, superscript
adapts to the height of the previous character. This is usually correct, but
when dealing with parentheses it may be a bit too low.
\begin{example}
\( a^2 \) is fine, but what
about \( (a^2)^2 \)?
\end{example}
In the example above the second superscript doesn't know about the first one
inside, and it adapts only to the height of the closing parenthesis. To fix
this enclose the parentheses in a group.
\begin{example}
\( {(a^2)}^2 \) is better.
\end{example}
In \autoref{sec:delimiters} we will also talk about growing parentheses that do
not have this problem.

To enter \wi{square root}s use the \csi{sqrt} command. It will automatically
overline the expression it received as the argument.
\begin{example}
From Homer's theorem it 
follows that
\[
  \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{c}
\]
so we can see that
\(c = \sqrt{2x^2+7}\).
\end{example}
The full syntax of the \csi{sqrt} is actually
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{sqrt}[n: o, expr: m]
\end{lscommand}
The optional argument \carg{n} allows you to typeset \carg{n}-th root
radicals.\footnote{The name \csi{sqrt} is a bit misleading in that respect
  \smiley.}
\begin{example}
Find three positive integers
\(a, b\) and \(c\), such that
\[
  a = \sqrt[7]{b^7 + c^7}
\]
\end{example}

Finally typesetting built-up fractions is made possible by the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{frac}[numerator:m, denominator:m]
\end{lscommand}
command.
\begin{example}
And since
\[
  \frac{a}{b} \leq
  \frac{a+c}{b+d} \leq
  \frac{c}{d}
\]
it follows that
\(x = \frac{\sqrt{z+3}}{y^3}\).
\end{example}

\subsection{Logic and Set Theory}

The basic logical operations can be typeset using rather self explanatory
commands: \csi{lnot}, \csi{land}, \csi{lor}, \csi{implies} and \csi{iff}.
\begin{example}
\[
  p \land q \iff 
  \lnot (p \implies \lnot q) 
\]
\end{example}
There's also a left facing implication named \csi{impliedBy}. Some less
established logical symbols can be also found under less intuitive names such
as \csi{veebar} that produces \(\veebar\) used by some for exclusive
disjunction. If you intend to use them make sure to use commands described in
\autoref{sec:new_commands} to create meaningful synonyms.

The quantifiers symbols can be typeset using \csi{forall} and \csi{exists}
commands.
\begin{example}
\[
  \lnot\forall_{q} P(q) \iff
  \exists_{q}\lnot P(q)
\]
\end{example}

To typeset sets use the \csi{\{} and \csi{\}} commands.
\begin{example}
\(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\)
\end{example}
To indicate set membership (\enquote{is element of}) you can use the \csi{in}
command.\footnote{Try to guess its left-flipped version name.} Sets defined by
a predicate are often written using a set-builder notation with a colon. The
naïve way would be to write it like this
\begin{example}
\( \{x \in X:
  \exists_n x^n = 1\} \)
\end{example}
The result doesn't look right though. The reason is the aforementioned
automatic spacing based on mathematical meaning. The \mintinline{latex}|:|
character is used in \LaTeX{} for ratios, such as \(1:2\), which is why it has
equal spacing on both of its sides. To typeset colons in a set-builder notation
use the \csi{colon} command instead.
\begin{example}
\(\{ X \ni x\colon
  \exists_n x^n = 1\} \)
\end{example}

The usual set inclusion symbols are accessible as \csi{subset}, \csi{subseteq}
and \csi{subsetneq}, while their flipped versions are accessible as
\csi{supset}, \csi{supseteq} and \csi{supsetneq}. The set union symbol is
hiding behind \csi{cup} while set intersection is \csi{cap}. Set difference is
just \csi{setminus} though. You may also find \csi{emptyset} useful.
\begin{example}
% TODO: Waiting for unicode-math fix
\RenewDocumentCommand{\setminus}{}{\smallsetminus}
\[
  \emptyset
  \subset X \setminus X
  \subseteq X \cap \emptyset
  \subsetneq X
  \supseteq X \cup X
\]
\end{example}

\subsection{Greek Letters}

Every mathematician knows that Latin alphabet just isn't enough. Accessing the
Greek alphabet is as easy as typing \csi{alpha}, \csi{beta}, \csi{gamma},
\ldots{} for lowercase letters and \csi{Alpha}, \csi{Beta}, \csi{Gamma},
\ldots{} for uppercase letters.%
\csih{alpha}\csih{beta}\csih{gamma}\csih{delta}\csih{epsilon}\csih{zeta}%
\csih{eta}\csih{theta}\csih{iota}\csih{kappa}\csih{lambda}\csih{mu}%
\csih{nu}\csih{xi}\csih{omicron}\csih{pi}\csih{rho}\csih{sigma}\csih{tau}%
\csih{upsilon}\csih{phi}\csih{chi}\csih{psi}\csih{omega}\csih{Alpha}%
\csih{Beta}\csih{Gamma}\csih{Delta}\csih{Epsilon}\csih{Zeta}\csih{Eta}%
\csih{Theta}\csih{Iota}\csih{Kappa}\csih{Lambda}\csih{Mu}\csih{Nu}\csih{Xi}%
\csih{Omicron}\csih{Pi}\csih{Rho}\csih{Sigma}\csih{Tau}\csih{Upsilon}%
\csih{Phi}\csih{Chi}\csih{Psi}\csih{Omega}
\begin{example}
Let \(\epsilon\) be a small
number and let  \(\Epsilon\)
be a large number.
\end{example}
As you can see above in most fonts (including the default \LaTeX{} one) there
is no visual difference between some uppercase Greek letters and their Latin
equivalents. If you want to use them, make sure they do not clash in your
document.

Some Greek letters have defined variants. These are accessible by prepending
the word \texttt{var} before the letter name, for example \csi{varepsilon}. A
list of all defined variants is presented in \autoref{tbl:greek_variants}.
\begin{table}
  \ExplSyntaxOn
  \NewDocumentCommand{\VariantShowcase}{m}{
    \csi{var#1} & \(\use:c{var#1}\) & \(\use:c{#1}\)
  }
  \ExplSyntaxOff
  \caption{Available variants of Greek letters.}\label{tbl:greek_variants}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
    \toprule
    Command & Variant & Main  \\
    \midrule
    \VariantShowcase{epsilon} \\
    \VariantShowcase{kappa}   \\
    \VariantShowcase{phi}     \\
    \VariantShowcase{pi}      \\
    \VariantShowcase{rho}     \\
    \VariantShowcase{sigma}   \\
    \VariantShowcase{theta}   \\
    \VariantShowcase{Theta}   \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note that all of the Greek letters in math mode, similarly to Latin letters,
are considered to be mathematical variables. In particular \csi{pi}
\emph{should not} be used to denote the famous constant.

\subsection{Mathematical Fonts and How To Use Them}

When writing mathematics it is often the case that we use different fonts for
mathematical symbols depending on the object they represent. For example the
variables are typeset using the italic font, while known sets often get
a fancy double-struck ((also known as \enquote*{blackboard bold})) font, for example \(\symbb{N}\). You can access various fonts by using
the family of \cs{sym...} commands. For example to typeset double-struck
letters use the \csi{symbb} command.
\begin{example}
\[
  \forall_{p \in \symbb{P}}
  \exists_{n \in \symbb{N}}
  p < 5 \lor p = 24n + 1
\]
\end{example}
All font changing commands are listed in \autoref{tbl:sym_commands}.
\begin{table}
  \ExplSyntaxOn
  \NewDocumentCommand{\Ncmmr}{m}{
    \setmathfont{New Computer Modern Math Regular}

      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
\end{table}

Avoid writing these commands directly in your formulas, you should create
logical wrappers around them. For example, the
\citetitle{iso80000-2}~\cite{iso80000-2} standard states that mathematical
constants should be written in a Roman (upright) font. Writing
\mintinline{latex}|\symrm{e}| every time we want to refer to the base of
natural logarithm will make the code less readable, so below we create simple
wrappers for the constants we are going to use.
\begin{example}[vertical_mode, examplewidth=0.7\linewidth]
\NewDocumentCommand{\e}{}{\symrm{e}}
\NewDocumentCommand{\im}{}{\symrm{i}}
\NewDocumentCommand{\cpi}{}{\symrm{\pi}}
\[ \e^{\im\cpi} + 1 = 0 \]
\end{example}

Known functions such as \(\sin\) or \(\log\) should also be written in Roman,
however you should not use the \csi{symrm} command to do so. As the name of the
command indicates, it is meant to be used for mathematical symbols. Since in
\(\sin\) name \(s\), \(i\) and \(n\) are not symbols, but a components of a
single operator name, there are separate commands for typesetting these.
Fortunately you do not have to access them directly since many of the standard
functions are already defined.
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{\cpi}{}{\symrm{\pi}} %!hide
\NewDocumentCommand{\e}{}{\symrm{e}} %!hide
\( \cos(2\cpi) = \ln(\e) \)
\end{example}
The full list of predefined functions is presented in \autoref{tbl:functions}.
\begin{table}
  \caption{All functions predefined by \LaTeX{}.}\label{tbl:functions}
  \begin{tabular}{llllll}
    \toprule
    \csi{arccos} & \csi{cos}  & \csi{csc} & \csi{exp}  & \csi{ker}    & \csi{limsup} \\

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

If these are not enough for you, use the \csi{DeclareMathOperator} command to
define your own. It can be only used in the preamble.
\begin{example}[vertical_mode, examplewidth=0.6\linewidth]
%!showbegin !hide
% In preamble
\DeclareMathOperator{\argh}{argh}
% ...
%!showend !hide
\[ \argh(x) = \sinh(\max(x, x^2)) \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Big Operators}

At the beginning of the \autoref{sec:single_equations} we have shown the
summation operator to show off capabilities of mathematical typesetting. To
typeset it use the \csi{sum} command. Its lower and upper limits are specified
by the sub- and superscript operators.
\begin{example}
\(
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k^2}
\)
\end{example}
As you saw its appearance in text style starkly differs from the one in the
display style.
\begin{example}
\[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k^2}
\]
\end{example}

This is an example of what's commonly known as big operator. There are other
such operators, such as \csi{prod} for products, or \csi{bigwedge} for
conjunctions. Some of the functions listed in \autoref{tbl:functions} are also
big operators.
\begin{example}
\[
  c = \max_{x\in X} f(x)
\]
\end{example}

You can define your own big operators by using a starred version of the
\csi{DeclareMathOperator} command.
\begin{example}[vertical_mode, examplewidth=0.6\linewidth]
%!showbegin !hide
% In preamble
\DeclareMathOperator*{\nut}{Nut}
% ...
%!showend !hide
\[ \nut_y = \lim_{x \to y} \argh{x} \]
\end{example}

If you have a long limit, it may make sense to typeset it vertically instead of
horizontally. This can be done using the \csi{substack} command. Inside you can
place \cs{\bs} to indicate where new lines should be started.
\begin{example}
\[
  \sum^n_{
    \substack{0<i<n \\ 
    j\subseteq i}
  }
   P(i,j) = Q(i,j)
\]
\end{example}

Integral symbol is also a big operator, but it only shifts the lower limit left.
\begin{example}
\[
  \int_a^b \liminf_{a \to x} a^2
\]
\end{example}
Due to the fact that the symbol is very slanted to the right,
typesetting multiple integrals leads to excessive space around them. You
should use \csi{iint},\csi{iiint},\csi{iiiint} if you want to typeset them.
\begin{example}
\[ \int\int\int\int \]
vs.\ 
\[ \iiiint \]
\end{example}

If you want to suppress the big operators limits and typeset normal sub- or
supscript next to them, you can simply surround them with curly braces.
\begin{example}
\[
  {\sum_{a}}^b
  \qquad%!hide
  {\int}_a^b
  \qquad%!hide
  {\nut^b}_a
\]
\end{example}
However if a long long limit is present this may lead to excessive spacing
before the sub- or supscripts.
\begin{example}
\[ {\sum_{loooooong}}^{b} \]
\end{example}
To fix the issue use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{sideset}[left: m, right: m, symbol: m]
\end{lscommand}
command. It surrounds the \carg{symbol} with left and right commands before
typesetting its limits.
\begin{example}[vertical_mode, examplewidth=0.7\linewidth]
\[ \sideset{^{a}}{^{b}}{\sum}_{loooooong} \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Math Accents}

To denote arithmetic mean taken over a variable, a notation with a bar over the
variable is used: \(\bar x\). If you remember the \autoref{accents} from
\autopageref{accents} you may think that it would be possible to write it as
\mintinline{latex}|\=x|. This will not work though. In fact none of the
commands from this table will work in math mode. There is a good conceptual
reason for that---the accents listed there are meant to typeset non-Latin
letters that are used in various languages. The character
\mintinline{latex}|\"u| is meant to represent u-umlaut and the correct glyph
for it will be chosen if it exists in the current font. In math we don't want
an u-umlaut---we want \enquote{double dot above} operator applied to variable
\(u\), thus different commands are used to achieve that.

To actually get a bar over a variable you can use the \csi{bar} command. Other
accents\index{mathematical!accents} include \csi{hat}, \csi{grave},
\csi{acute}, \csi{tilde} or \csi{ddot}. Refer to~\cite{unicode-math-symbols}
for a full list.
\begin{example}
\(\bar{x}\) \(\hat{x}\)
\(\grave{x}\) \(\acute{x}\)
\(\tilde{x}\) \(\ddot{x}\)
\end{example}

Some accents also exist in a \enquote*{wide} version. These can encompass more
than one character. Compare \csi{hat} to \csi{widehat} in the example below.
\begin{example}
\(\hat{ABC}\) vs.\
\(\widehat{ABC}\)
\end{example}
The wide version of \csi{bar} accent is called \csi{overline}. It is useful if
you want to mark the repetend of a decimal fraction.
\begin{example}
\(0.123\overline{456789}\)
\end{example}

Some wide accents even have limits. For example, the \csi{overbrace} and
\csi{underbrace} commands enable you to create horizontal braces with an
expression above or below them.
\begin{example}
\[
  \underbrace{
    \overbrace{(a+b+c)}^6 
    \times
    \overbrace{(d+e+f)}^7
  }_{\text{meaning of life}}=42
\]
\end{example}

If the default accents are not enough for you you can create your own using
\csi{overset} and \csi{underset}.
\begin{example}
\(\overset{\text{foo}}{x}\)
\(\underset{\times}{A}\)
\end{example}
These commands may also be used when creating custom \wi{binary relations},
though you may check whether the one you are trying to define is not already predefined.
\begin{example}
\(a \overset{\text{def}}{=} b\)
vs.\ \(a \eqdef b\)
\end{example}

\subsection{Delimiters}\label{sec:delimiters}

Besides the standard parentheses, brackets and braces, \LaTeX{} provides all
sorts of symbols for \wi{delimiters}, such as
\begin{example}
\[
  \langle x \rangle
  \; %!hide
  \lBrack x \rBrack 
  \; %!hide
  \lfloor x \rfloor
  \; %!hide
  \lvert x \rvert
\]
\end{example}
While all of them work fine for small input, things get ugly when the
expression inside them starts getting tall.
\begin{example}[vertical_mode, examplewidth=0.8\linewidth]
\[
  {\lfloor
    \frac
    {{\langle\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k^{-4}\rangle}^3}
    {\frac{{\lvert\{a,b,c\}\rvert}^8}{{(x^4)}^3}}
  \rfloor}^6
\]
\end{example}

To fix this you can use the \csi{left} and \csi{right} commands. These take one
argument---the delimiter to extend---and adapt its size based on the content
they delimit. You must close every \csi{left} with a corresponding \csi{right}
but they do not have to use the same delimiter.
\begin{chktexignore}
\begin{example}
\[
  \left(
    \frac{1}{1 +
      \frac{1}{1 +
        \frac{1}{1 +
          \frac{1}{1 +
            \ldots}}}}
  \right]
\]
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}
If you want to typeset delimiter only on one side of the expression, a special
value may be passed: the dot character \ai{.}, which is treated as an invisible
delimiter.
\begin{example}
\[
  x = \left.
    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}
      \frac{1}{k^2}
  \right\}
\]
\end{example}

While using the \csi{left} and \csi{right} commands directly is sometimes
necessary, the simplest case of using some predefined delimiters on both sides
is the most common. For this usage the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{DeclarePairedDelimiter}[name: M, left delim: m, right delim: m]
\end{lscommand}
is really useful. It declares the \carg{name} command which simply encloses its
argument between \carg{left delim} and \carg{right delim}, while its starred
version additionally uses \csi{left} and \csi{right} commands when typesetting
delimiters.
\begin{chktexignore}
\begin{example}[vertical_mode, examplewidth=0.8\linewidth]
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\set}{\{}{\}}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\size}{\lvert}{\rvert}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\mean}{\langle}{\rangle}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\floor}{\lfloor}{\rfloor}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\parens}{(}{)}
\[
  \floor*{
    \frac
    {\mean*{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k^{-4}}^3}
    {\frac{\size*{\set{a,b,c}}^8}{\parens*{x^4}^3}}
  }^6
\]
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

In some special circumstances you may also want to select the size of the
delimiter yourself. You can do this using  \csi{big}, \csi{Big}, \csi{bigg} and
\csi{Bigg} commands. These may be either prepended to delimiting symbol with
\enquote{l} and \enquote{r} suffixes or passed as an optional argument to a
declared delimiter.
\begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{%
  \set}{\{}{\}}
\( \bigl[ \ddagger \Biggr) \)
\quad %!hide
\( \set[\Big]{1,\frac{3}{4}} \)
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

If the \csi{DeclarePairedDelimiter} is not enough for you, there also exists
more powerful \csi{DeclarePairedDelimiterX}, which is described in the
documentation of \pai*{mathtools} package.

\section{Multiline Equations}\index{long equations}

The math environments so far discussed only allow typesetting a single line
equation. However, sometimes an equation might be too long to fit.
\begin{example}
\begin{equation}
  a = b + c + d + e + f 
  + g + h + i + j 
  + k + l + m + n + o + p  
\end{equation}
\end{example}
In this case it is necessary to introduce linebreaks inside the equation. When
doing so, it is important to remember a few rules to improve the readability:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In general one should always break an equation \emph{before} an
        equality sign or an operator.
  \item A break before an equality sign is preferable to a break before
        any operator.
  \item A break before a plus- or minus-operator is preferable to a break
        before a multiplication-operator.
  \item Any other type of break should be avoided if at all possible.
\end{enumerate}

This section will introduce several environments to typeset equations with
linebreaks inside them. These and more are described in more detail in the
\pai*{amsmath} package documentation.

\subsection{Long Equations}\label{sec:multline}

The easiest way to display long equations is the \ei{multline} environment. It
allows to introduce linebreaks with the \csi{\bs} command.
\begin{example}
\begin{multline}
  a + b + c + d + e + f
  + g + h + i \\
  = j + k + l + m + n
\end{multline}
\end{example}
The first line in \ei{multline} environment is aligned to the left, the last
one to the right, while all the others are centred.
\begin{example}
\begin{multline}
  l + e + f + t \\
  + c + e + n + t + r + e \\
  = r + i + g + h + t
\end{multline}
\end{example}

If you do not want some particular inner line centred, you can use
\csi{shoveleft} and \csi{shoveright} commands to force the line to be left or
right aligned.
\begin{example}
\begin{multline}
  l + e + f + t \\
  \shoveleft{+ left + again} \\
  \shoveright{+ now + right} \\
  = r + i + g + h + t
\end{multline}
\end{example}

Similarly to \ei{equation*} there also exists a \ei{multline*} version that
suppresses the equation number.

\subsection{Multiple Unaligned Equations}\index{equation!multiple}

Sometimes we may want to typeset several related equations, but typesetting
them within several \env{equation} environments produces unneeded spacing
between them.
\begin{example}
\begin{equation}
  2 + 2 = 4
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  2 \times 2 = 4
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  2 + 2 \times 2 = 6
\end{equation}
\end{example}
In that case you may use the \ei{gather} environment. It allows you to break
lines using the \csi{\bs} command and centres each equation.
\begin{example}
\begin{gather}
  2 + 2 = 4 \\
  2 \times 2 = 4 \\
  2 + 2 \times 2 = 6
\end{gather}
\end{example}
The equation numbering commands such as \csi{eqref}, \csi{label} and \csi{tag}
now apply to a single line they are present in. Additionally the command
\csi{notag} is defined that allows you to suppress equation numbering for a
single line.
\begin{example}
\begin{gather}
  2 + 2 = 4
    \tag{Easy}\label{easy} \\
  2 \times 2 = 4 \notag \\
  2 + 2 \times 2 = 6
    \label{hard}
\end{gather}
The~\eqref{easy} is easier
than~\eqref{hard}.
\end{example}
The above example also illustrates that the centring of the equations inside
the environment may depend upon the length of the tag. Keep that in mind if
your tags and/or equations get long.

As always, the starred version of the environment, \ei{gather*}, suppresses
all equation numbers.

\subsection{Multiple Aligned Equations}

If the gathered equations have a natural midpoint, it may be the case that the
\ei{align} environment is much better suited to typeset them. It allows you to
align the equations by inserting the \ai{\&} character, similarly to the
\env{tabular} environment. Note that the \ai{\&} should come \emph{before} any
binary operator in order to produce the correct spacing.
\begin{example}
\begin{align}
  2 + 2 & = 2 \times 2 \\
  3 + 3 & \neq 3 \times 3 \\
  2 + 2 \times 2 & < 8
\end{align}
\end{example}

The environment allows to put more than one equation in a single line by
using several \ai{\&}. They are considered to be paired, so every second
alignment character will produce a bigger space to accommodate for the spacing
between columns.
\begin{example}
\begin{align}
  a & \succeq b & c & \leq d \\
  a & \geq d & d & \prec c
\end{align}
\end{example}

The \ei{align} environment is also really useful when writing transformations of
a single equation in multiple lines.
\begin{example}
\begin{align}
  \sum_{k=0}^n k 
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \\
    &= \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n \\
    &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{align}
\end{example}
We may use the additional columns and the \csi{text} command to put line by
line comments in such transformations.
\begin{example}
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{k=0}^n k
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n
      && \text{definition} \\
    &= \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} + n
      && \text{induction} \\
    &= \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
      && \text{trivial}
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\subsection{Equations as Building Blocks}

All the environments presented above can be used inside another equations by
appending \enquote{-ed} to their name. They no longer number the equations
inside them and accept an optional vertical positioning argument, with the
same semantics as the one accepted by tabular (see \autoref{sec:tables} on
\autopageref{sec:tables}).
\begin{example}
\[
  \begin{multlined}[t]
    1 + 2 \\
    + 3 + 4
  \end{multlined} =
  \begin{gathered}[c]
    1 + 2 \\
    + 3 + 4
  \end{gathered} =
  \begin{aligned}[b]
    1 & + 2 \\
      & + 3 + 4
  \end{aligned}
\]
\end{example}
These are useful if you want to, for example, break an equation into multiple
lines with alignment, but still retain only a single equation number.
\begin{example}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    2 + 2 \times 2 
      &= 2 \times 2 + 2 \\ 
      &\neq 2 \times (2 + 2) \\ 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{example}
They can be also freely nested, if a need arises.
\begin{example}
\begin{align}
  a + b + c
    &= \begin{multlined}[t]
      long \\
      multiline \\
      equation \\
      inside \\
      align
    \end{multlined} \\
    &= \begin{aligned}[t]
      1 &+ long \\
        &- aligned \\
        &+ equation \\
        &\div inside \\
        &\times align
    \end{aligned} \\
    &= d + e + f
\end{align}
\end{example}

\subsection{IEEEeqnarray Environment}\label{sec:IEEEeqnarray_intro}

If the environments defined in \ei{amsmath} do not meet your needs, you can try
the \ei{IEEEeqnarray} from the \pai*{IEEEtrantools} package. It allows you to
specify the alignment of each math column separately similarly to the
\env{tabular} environment. Here we will present some of its basic
functionalities. More can found in its official manual~\cite{IEEEtran_HOWTO}.
The part about \texttt{IEEEeqnarray} can be found in Appendix~F.

To specify columns use \cargv{l}, \cargv{c} and \cargv{r}. Their uppercase
version also adds a small space around the column, which is useful in case of
binary operators. For example to emulate the \ei{align} environment we could
use \cargv{rCl}, i.e., three columns, the first column right-justified, the
middle one centred with a little more space around it and the third column
left-justified:
\begin{example}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  a & = & b + c \\
  & = & d + e + f + g + h \\
  & = & i + j + k 
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
\end{example}

In contrast to the \pai{amsmath} environments, the \ei{IEEEeqnarray} does not
try to avoid the numbering collision with its content.
\begin{example}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  a & = & b + c \\
  & = & d + e + f 
    + g + h + i + j \\
  & = & k + l + m + n.
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
\end{example}
To avoid it use the \csi{IEEEeqnarraynumspace} in the offending line. It will
shift the whole equation left to accommodate for the number present in the
given line.
\begin{example}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  a & = & b + c  \\
  & = & d + e + f 
    + g + h + i + j
    \IEEEeqnarraynumspace \\
  & = & k + l + m + n.
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
\end{example}

You can also use the \csi{IEEEeqnarraymulticol} to adjust only a single line
within the environment, with its usage similar to the \cs{multicol}.
\begin{example}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  \IEEEeqnarraymulticol{3}{l}{
    a + b + c + d = e + f 
  } \\
  e + f & = & g + h \\
  & = & i + j + k + l + m
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
\end{example}

If a particular line should not have an equation number, the number can be
suppressed using \csi{notag} as discussed before. Additionally the
\pai{IEEEtrantools} defines \csi{IEEEyesnumber} and \csi{IEEEyessubnumber}. The
former command can be used to turn on the numbering if the starred version of
the environment is used.
\begin{example}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
  a & = & b + c \\
  & = & d + e \IEEEyesnumber\\
  & = & f + g
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
\end{example}
The latter changes numbering to indicate subexpressions.
\begin{example}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  a & = & b + c \\
  & = & d + e \notag \\
  & = & f + g
    \IEEEyessubnumber  
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
\end{example}
Note that eventual \cs{label} commands should follow after these.

\section{Units}\label{sec:units}\index{units (SI)}\index{SI}

When dealing with real world data you will often find yourself writing units
such as \qty{10}{\kg} or \qty{25}{\coulomb\per\mole}. In technical writing it
is crucial to accurately convey values to avoid errors and ambiguity.
The \emph{International System of Units} (\emph{SI})~\cite{si}, comes with a detailed set
of typesetting rules. For example you may have noticed that in the
first sentence the space between \num{10} and \unit{\kg} is smaller than
between the words.

Fortunately thanks to the logical nature of \LaTeX{} markup and the excellent
\pai*{siunitx} package you do not need to know most of the rules. Just use the special unit-commands provided by the package and all the units in your document will be
typeset correctly.

\subsection{Pitfalls of Naïvely Entered Units}

Naïvely, one might write units like this:
\begin{example}
The speed of light
is exactly 299792458 m/s.
\end{example}
This may look fine initially but if your document gets longer you will probably
get into a situation where an unfortunate linebreak occurs.
\begin{example}
\ldots{} The speed of light
is 299792458 m/s. Thus we
can calculate \ldots
\end{example}
A non-breaking space will fix this problem, but the next one is already waiting---the space between numbers. Digits of
long numbers should be grouped to make them easier to read. The above example
should then written like this:
\begin{example}
The speed of light is
299\,792\,458~m/s.
\end{example}
Yet another problem arises when trying to write the units inside math
mode
\begin{example}
\(10~\frac{m}{s}
  \cdot 12~s = 120~m\)
\end{example}
Here we need to make sure that the units are written in roman font.
The above example should be then written as
\begin{example}
\(10~\frac{\mathrm{m}}
  {\mathrm{s}} 
  \cdot 12~\mathrm{s} 
  = 120~\mathrm{m}\)
\end{example}
\noindent Hopefully these examples illustrate why a better method is needed.

\subsection{Basic Commands of the \pai{siunitx} Package}

The basic commands of \pai{siunitx} package are
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{num}[options: o, number: m]\\
  \csi{unit}[options: o, unit: m]\\
  \csi{qty}[options:o, number:m, unit:m]
\end{lscommand}
The \csi{num} command typesets a number, \csi{unit} typesets a unit, and
\csi{qty} typesets a quantity, i.e.\ a number followed by a unit. All of the
commands provide optional \carg{options} argument, which is a comma delimited
key-value pair list that can influence the output of the command. The
\carg{unit} argument can be provided in one of two styles, either
\enquote{literal} or \enquote{interpreted}.

In literal mode units are entered as strings of letters
\begin{example}
\unit{kg} is a unit,
\qty{10}{m/s} is a quantity
\end{example}
Spaces in literal mode are ignored. If you want to insert a product of units,
use either dot \ai{.} or tilde \ai{\~{}}.
\begin{example}
\unit{N} is 
not \unit{kg m / s^2},
but \unit{kg.m / s^2}
or \unit{kg~m / s^2}
\end{example}

On the other hand, in interpreted mode units are entered using predefined
macros
\begin{example}
\unit{\kilo\gram} is a unit,
\qty{10}{\metre\per\second}
is a quantity
\end{example}
At first glance this may seem less convenient, but this enables the package to
recognise the logical structure of the units, which means that the formatting
can be changed on the fly.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
Which one do you prefer:
\(\unit{\newton} = \unit{
  \kilo\gram\metre\per\square\second}\),
\(\unit{\newton} = \unit[per-mode = fraction]{
  \kilo\gram\metre\per\second\squared}\) or
\(\unit{\N} = \unit[per-mode = symbol]{
  \kg\m\per\s\tothe{2}}\)?
\end{example}
The commands \csi{gram}, \csi{kilo}, \csi{per} are rather self explanatory. As you
can see we have also used the \cargv{per-mode} option to influence the unit
style. While the command \csi{tothe} typesets arbitrary superscripts, the
command \csi{of} typesets arbitrary subscripts, known as qualifiers.
\begin{example}
\unit{\kg\of{mol}},
\unit{\bel\of{i}}
\end{example}

Note that the \csi{per} command by default only works on the next unit. If we
want it to apply to all following units we may use \cargv{sticky-per} option.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.7\linewidth, vertical_mode]
The unit of thermal conductivity is
\unit{\watt\per\metre\per\kelvin}
or equivalently
\unit[sticky-per]{\m\kg\per\s\cubed\K}. 
\end{example}

Sometimes you may want to make the units use a different colour so they figure more prominently. This can be done using \cargv{unit-color}. Options
\cargv{number-color} and \cargv{color} may be used to colour only the numeric
values or whole quantities. If you want to highlight a single unit in a
compound unit, you may use the \csi{highlight} command.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\qty[unit-color = red   ]{9.81}{\m\per\s\squared},
\qty[number-color = blue]{9.81}{\m\per\s\squared},
\qty[color = green      ]{9.81}{\m\per\s\squared},
\qty{9.81}{\m\per\highlight{orange}\s\squared}
\end{example}

Now let's turn our attention to numbers. The numeric values will always use dot
as a decimal separator, regardless of entered symbol. If you want to use comma
as a decimal separator, change the \cargv{output-decimal-marker} option.
\begin{example}
\(\pi \approx \num{3.14159}\)
\\ %!hide
\(\pi \approx \num{3,14159}\)
\\ %!hide
\(\pi \approx \num[
  output-decimal-marker={,}
]{3.14159}\)
\end{example}

The numbers may also be entered using exponent notation. The symbol before
exponent and base may be controlled using \cargv{exponent-product} and
\cargv{exponent-base} options
\begin{example}
\(\qty{1}{\tonne} 
  = \qty{1e6}{\g}\) \\
\(\qty{1}{\gibi\byte} = \qty[
  exponent-base = 2,
]{1e30}{\byte}\) \\
\(\qty{1}{\L} = \qty[
  exponent-product = \cdot,
]{1e-3}{\cubic\m}\)
\end{example}

If we want all numbers to be formatted using exponent notation, regardless of
their entered form, we may use \cargv{exponent-mode} option.
\begin{example}
\(2^{16} = \num{65536}\) \\
\(2^{16} = \num[
  exponent-mode = scientific,
]{65536}\) \\
\(2^{16} = \num[
  exponent-mode = engineering,
]{65536}\) \\
\(2^{16} = \num[
  exponent-mode = fixed,
]{65.536e3}\) \\
\(2^{16} = \num[
  exponent-mode = fixed,
  fixed-exponent = 5,
]{65.536e3}\)
\end{example}

In some fields it may be common to write uncertainty next to numbers. This may
also be done in several ways. In order to customise the appearance of
uncertainty use the \cargv{uncertainty-mode} option.
\begin{example}
\(M_\oplus = \qty{
  5.9722(6) e24}{\kg}\)
  \\ %!hide
\(M_\oplus = \qty{
  5.9722 +- 0.0006 e24}{\kg}\)
  \\ %!hide
\(M_\oplus = \qty{
  5.9722 \pm 0.0006 e24}{\kg}\)
  \\ %!hide
\(M_\oplus = \qty[
    uncertainty-mode = separate
  ]{5.9722(6) e24}{\kg}\)
  \\ %!hide
\(M_\oplus = \qty[
  uncertainty-mode = full
]{5.9722(6) e24}{\kg}\)
\end{example}

By default \pai{siunitx} typesets the quantities in math mode. This may be
especially jarring if you use different font for the document text. One simple
solution is to set the \cargv{mode} option to \cargv{text}.
% TODO: Add pointer to changing math fonts section when written.
\begin{example}
\setmainfont{Source Sans Pro} %!hide
\qty{1}{\degreeCelsius} is
equal to \qty{1}{\kelvin},
but \qty[
  mode = text,
]{0}{\degreeCelsius} is \qty[
  mode = text,
]{-273.15}{\kelvin}.
Bizarre, isn't it?
\end{example}

The behaviour of the commands may be customised even further. For a full list
of options check out the \pai{siunitx} package documentation.

To avoid repeating the options with every use of commands, use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{sisetup}[options: m]
\end{lscommand}
command. It can be used in the preamble to ensure consistent style throughout
the document, or inside the document when the style needs to be changed just
in a given element, such as a table. These options may be also passed as package
options. \autoref{sistandaloneexa} shows an example usage of the package in
a full document.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[standalone, template=empty, examplewidth=\linewidth,paperwidth=12cm, paperheight=5.5cm, vertical_mode]
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[paperheight=\height,paperwidth=\width,margin=0.3cm]{geometry} %!hide
\sloppy %!hide
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage[per-mode = fraction, unit-color = red]{siunitx}

\begin{document}
Units are typeset like this: \qty{9.81}{\m\per\s\squared}.
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \sisetup{exponent-mode = fixed, fixed-exponent = 1}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
    \toprule
    No. & Result (\unit{\kg}) \\
    \midrule
    1   & \num{12.3}          \\ 
    2   & \num{0.3}           \\ 
    3   & \num{1e2}           \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Measurement results.
    Here custom options are used.}\label{table}
\end{table}

Now we are back to normal: \qty{3.637e-4}{\m\squared\per\s}.

\subsection{Other \pai{siunitx} Commands}

Besides the basic commands described above \pai{siunitx} also defines several
other useful commands.

Angles are special in that they use base \(60\) instead of base \(10\) when
subdividing. The command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{ang}[options: o, angle: m]
\end{lscommand}
exists in order to simplify entering them. If they are entered using semicolon
as a separator, then the following numbers are treated as minutes and seconds.
If they are given as a decimal number, they will be displayed as such.
\begin{example}
\ang{10}
\qquad %!hide
\ang{1;2;3}
\qquad %!hide
\ang{;;20} \\
\ang{32.5}
\qquad %!hide
\qty{60}{\degree}
\end{example}

When listing several numbers we may use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{numlist}[options: o, numbers: m]
\end{lscommand}
where \carg{numbers} are delimited by semicolons. This command is context aware
which means it will produce correct results when used with \pai{polyglossia}.
\begin{example}
\numlist{1;2;3;4}

\begin{german}
  \numlist{1;2;3;4}
\end{german}
\end{example}

The package contains also dedicated commands for dealing with products and
ranges of numbers. The numbers in product should be delimited with the \verb|x|
letter.
\begin{example}
Pick a number from
range \numrange{1}{10}. \\
\numproduct{2x5} is \(10\). \\
\begin{german}
  \numrange{1}{10}
\end{german}
\end{example}

All these commands also have quantity versions.
\begin{example}
Obtained results:
\qtylist{2;5;7}{\L}.\\
Acceptable range is
\qtyrange{1}{10}{\kg}. \\
This area is
\qtyproduct{2x5}{\metre}.
\end{example}

If we are dealing with quantum mechanics then complex numbers may be useful.
To typeset them use \csi{complexnum} and \csi{complexqty}. They can be entered in
both Cartesian form and polar coordinates.

\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.5\linewidth]
The conjugate of
\complexnum{2+3i} is
\complexnum{2-3i}
which is approximately
\complexnum{3.6056:-56.310}. \\
Why is my scale showing my
weight is
\complexqty{65+i21}{\kg}?
\end{example}

Sometimes the required unit that we want to use is missing. For example
throughout this book the unit of typographical point is used when talking about
font sizes. To define it we may use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{DeclareSIUnit}[options:o, unit:m, symbol:m]
\end{lscommand}
command. The \carg{unit} is the macro we will use in the interpreted mode,
while the \carg{symbol} is the typeset symbol. The \carg{options} allows us to
define default options concerning, for example, the spacing of the unit in
quantities.
\begin{example}
\DeclareSIUnit{\pt}{pt}
The default font size
in \LaTeX{} is \qty{10}{\pt}.
\end{example}

This command may also be used when we want to adjust the appearance of
predefined unit. For example, the default litre is typeset using uppercase
\enquote*{L} and you may want to change it to use lowercase \enquote*{l}
instead.
\begin{example}
Litre before redefining:
\unit{\L}. \\
\DeclareSIUnit{\litre}{l}
Litre after redefining:
\unit{\L}.
\end{example}

Similarly the commands
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{DeclareSIPrefix}    \\
  \csi{DeclareSIPower}     \\
  \csi{DeclareSIQualifier}
\end{lscommand}
allow definition of unit-related macros in case additional are needed.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\DeclareSIUnit{\pt}{pt}
\DeclareSIPower\quartic\tothefourth{4}
\DeclareSIPrefix\decakilo{dk}{4}
\DeclareSIQualifier\polymer{pol}

It's over \qty{9000}{\quartic\decakilo\pt\polymer}!
\end{example}

\subsection{Table Columns with Numbers}\label{sec:sitables}\index{decimal
  alignment}

When typesetting tables which contain numeric data it is often useful to align
them along the decimal point, so they can be compared easily. The \pai{siunitx}
package adds the special column specifier \cargv{S} for this purpose to the
\ei{tabular} environment. Non numeric data must be surrounded by curly brackets
in such columns.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.7\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\begin{tabular}{@{}lS@{}}
  \toprule
  Day       & {Candy eaten (\unit{\g})} \\
  \midrule
  Monday    & .3011                     \\
  Tuesday   & 54.86                     \\
  Wednesday & 1000.9722                 \\
  Thursday  & -1000.9722                \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{A simple example of using \pai{siunitx}'s \cargv{S} column
    specification.}
\end{listing}

When presenting numeric data, such as above, it is good to remember the
following two rules
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never drop the leading zero before the decimal point.
  \item If the unit is the same in all cells put it in the heading.
\end{itemize}
All the numbers in \cargv{S} columns are automatically parsed by \pai{siunitx},
which means that if we use it, the first rule will be enforced for us.

In order to influence parsing\slash{}displaying options of a
single column, pass them in square brackets to the column specification. See
\autoref{lst:siunitxS} for an example.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\DeclareSIUnit{\eur}{\euro}
\begin{tabular} {
    @{}l
    S[output-decimal-marker={,},
      per-mode=symbol]@{}
  }
  \toprule
  Candy        & {Price (\unit{\eur\per\kg})} \\
  \midrule
  Chocolate    & 11.30                        \\
  Lollipops    & 15.86                        \\
  Marshmallows & 5.97                         \\
  Golden taffy & 1125.12                      \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{An example of using optional parameters in a single \cargv{S}
    column specification.}\label{lst:siunitxS}
\end{listing}

Besides standard options there are also table specific options that can be
passed to the columns. An important one is \cargv{table-format}. By default the
\cargv{S} specifier centres the decimal point leaving equal space to the left
and to the right of it. This leads to a lot of empty space if lengths of
integer and fraction parts are widely different as can be seen in
\autoref{lst:toowide}.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.7\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\sisetup{exponent-mode = fixed}
\begin{tabular} {@{}SS@{}}
  \toprule
  {\unit{\ug}} & {\unit{\kg}} \\
  \midrule
  1 & 1e-9 \\
  0.2 & 2e-10 \\
  35 & 35e-8 \\
  -100 & -1e-7 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{An anti-example of using \pai{siunitx}'s \cargv{S} column
    specification without setting the \cargv{table-format}.}\label{lst:toowide}
\end{listing}
We can then use
\cargv{table-format} to instruct \LaTeX{} how much space should be reserved
before and after dot. For example \cargv{6.2} means that it should reserve
space for 6 digits before the decimal point, and for two after. The format may
also contain information about signs, exponents or text around numbers. See
\autoref{lst:tableformat} for an example.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.7\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\sisetup{exponent-mode = fixed}
\begin{tabular} {
    @{}
    S[table-format = +3.1]
    S[table-format = +1.10]
    @{}
  }
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{Weight} \\
  \midrule
  {\unit{\ug}} & {\unit{\kg}} \\
  \midrule
  1 & 1e-9 \\
  0.2 & 2e-10 \\
  35 & 35e-8 \\
  -100 & -1e-7 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{An example of using \pai{siunitx}'s \cargv{S} column
    specification with the \cargv{table-format} key.}\label{lst:tableformat}
\end{listing}

By default numbers and text within the \cargv{S} columns and centred. If you
want to change the alignment use the \cargv{table-number-alignment} and
\cargv{table-text-alignment} options. See \autoref{lst:salignment} for an example.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.7\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\begin{tabular} {
    @{}
    S[
      table-format = 2.1(1.1),
      table-number-alignment = left,
      uncertainty-mode = separate,
    ]
    S[
      table-format = 2.2e2{ big!},
      table-text-alignment = right,
    ]
    @{}
  }
  \toprule
  {Confidence (\unit{\percent})}
    & {Value} \\
  \midrule
  57.1(2) & 10e2 \\
  25.3(0) & 2e-1 \\
  0(0.1)  & 99.99e99{ big!} \\
  92(1)      & 7.2e10 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{An example of aligning text and numbers inside the \pai{siunitx}'s \cargv{S} column.}\label{lst:salignment}
\end{listing}
The numbers may also be aligned inside a \csi{multicol} or \csi{multirow},
using the \csi{tablenum} command as seen in \autoref{lst:tablenum}.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.75\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\sisetup{table-format = 4.4e1}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
  \toprule
  Candy     & Friend                         \\
  \midrule
  Chocolate & Peter                          \\
  Lollipop  & Jane                           \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tablenum{12,34 e0}}    \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tablenum{333.5567 e1}} \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tablenum{4563.21 e2}}  \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{An example of using the \csi{tablenum} command.}\label{lst:tablenum}
\end{listing}

If you don't want the decimal alignment but still would like to have
numbers in columns formatted by \pai{siunitx}, change the
\cargv{table-alignment-mode} to \cargv{none}. See \autoref{lst:snoalignment}
for an example.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}
\sisetup{
  table-alignment-mode = none,
  output-decimal-marker = {,},
  unit-color = red,
}
\begin{tabular}{@{}cS@{}}
  \toprule
  Variable & {Value} \\
  \midrule
  foo & 101.892 \\
  bar & 2e-1 \\
  baz & \qty{2.1}{\kg}  \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{An example of using the \cargv{S} column specifier without aligning
    numbers.}\label{lst:snoalignment}
\end{listing}

\section{Matrices and the like}\label{sec:arraymat}

Typesetting matrices\index{matrix} in \LaTeX{} is possible with the \ei{matrix}
environment from the \pai*{amsmath} packages. It simply aligns the lines and
columns similarly to \env{tabular} and does not produce any delimiters around
its contents. In contrast to tabular it does not accept column specification
and each of its entries is typeset in math mode. The maximum number of columns a matrix can have is \(10\).
\begin{example}
\( \left[
  \begin{matrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  3 & 4 \\
  \end{matrix}
  \right] \)
\end{example}

Because matrices are usually delimited, there are five additional versions that
simply surround the matrix contents within delimiters. These are
\begin{description}
  \item[\ei{pmatrix}] that uses parentheses as delimiters:
    \(\bigl(
    \begin{smallmatrix}
      1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4 \\
    \end{smallmatrix}
    \bigr)\).
  \item[\ei{bmatrix}] that uses brackets as delimiters:
    \(\bigl[
      \begin{smallmatrix}
        1 & 2 \\
        3 & 4 \\
      \end{smallmatrix}
      \bigr]\).
  \item[\ei{Bmatrix}] that uses braces as delimiters:
    \(\bigl\{
    \begin{smallmatrix}
      1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4 \\
    \end{smallmatrix}
    \bigr\}\).
  \item[\ei{vmatrix}] that uses vertical lines as delimiters:
    \(\bigl\vert
    \begin{smallmatrix}
      1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4 \\
    \end{smallmatrix}
    \bigr\vert\).
  \item[\ei{Vmatrix}] that uses double vertical lines as delimiters:
    \(\bigl\Vert
    \begin{smallmatrix}
      1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4 \\
    \end{smallmatrix}
    \bigr\Vert\).
\end{description}

Matrices used these environments are rather large, because they are meant to be
typeset in display math. If for some reason you want to typeset a matrix within
text you may get better results with the \ei{smallmatrix} environment. Note
that there are no delimited variants of it so you must provide delimiters
yourself.
\begin{example}
Compare \(
  \begin{matrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    3 & 4 \\
  \end{matrix}
\) with \(
  \begin{smallmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    3 & 4 \\
  \end{smallmatrix}
\)
\end{example}

With matrices you could provide p

With the \ei{matrix} environment could also be used to typeset \wi{piecewise
  function}s by using the \cargv{.} character as an invisible \csi{right}
delimiter with brace. However, a much better alternative is the \ei{cases}
environments. Its contents are left aligned and the delimiters are already
provided.
\begin{example}
\[
  |x| = 
  \begin{cases}
    -x & \text{if } x < 0, \\
    0  & \text{if } x = 0, \\
    x  & \text{if } x > 0.
  \end{cases} 
\]
\end{example}

If you need more control over the alignment of the individual columns you may
also use the \ei{array} environment. It accepts the column specifier, just like
the \env{tabular}, but typesets its contents in math mode. Note that it
introduces a bit more spacing compared to the \ei{matrix} environments.
\begin{example}
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    12 & 1 & 21 \\
    1 & 22 & 101 \\
  \end{array}
\]
\end{example}

\section{Spacing in Math Mode}\label{sec:math-spacing}%
\index{math spacing}

\subsection{Mathematical Object Classes}

\LaTeX{} decides how much space to surround the symbols in math mode based
on their \emph{class}. For example, the \(\leq\) belongs to class of binary
relations so it is typeset with surrounding spaces. The class of a symbol can be
changed using the commands listed in \autoref{tbl:math_classes}.
\begin{table}
  \caption{Commands to influence mathematical object classes}\label{tbl:math_classes}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}cp{4.5cm}p{2.5cm}@{}}
    \toprule
    Command         & Explanation
                    & Examples                                                       \\
    \midrule
    \csi{mathord}   & Ordinary symbols, that do not require any special handling
                    & \mintinline{latex}|x| \(x\) \newline \csi{bot} \(\bot\)        \\
    \csi{mathop}    & Large operators, that are vertically centred within expression
                    & \csi{sum} \(\sum\) \newline \csi{bigcap} \(\bigcap\)           \\
    \csi{mathbin}   & Binary operators, with extra spacing around them
                    & \mintinline{latex}|+| \(+\) \newline \csi{times} \(\times\)    \\
    \csi{mathrel}   & Binary relations, with extra spacing around them
                    & \mintinline{latex}|=| \(=\) \newline \csi{succeq} \(\succeq\)  \\
    \csi{mathopen}  & Symbols that open groups, with space before
                    & \mintinline{latex}|(| \((\) \newline \csi{lBrack} \(\lBrack\)  \\ %chktex 36
    \csi{mathclose} & Symbols that close groups, with space after
                    & \mintinline{latex}|)| \()\) \newline \csi{rBrack} \(\rBrack\)  \\
    \csi{mathpunct} & Punctuation symbols, with space after
                    & \mintinline{latex}|,| \(,\) \newline \csi{colon} \(\colon\)    \\ %chktex 40
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
For example, the symbol \(R\) is normally treated as alphabetical character,
but we may force it to treat is as relation symbol using the \csi{mathrel}
command.
\begin{example}
Let \(R\) be any relation.
We should now write it like 
this \(a \mathrel{R} b\),
and not like this \(a R b\).
\end{example}

It is important to use symbols with proper classes while typesetting
mathematics. Some symbols may look the same as a single glyph but are different
in terms of their classes. For example, the \csi{bot} and \csi{perp} look very
similar, but the former is meant to typeset a symbol, while the latter
represents relation of perpendicularity.
\begin{example}
Let \(x \in \{\top, \bot\}\).
\\ %!hide
Given two lines \(k \perp l\).
\end{example}

Presented commands should not be used throughout the body of the document. If
you want use a new symbol (for example, an image) or repurpose an old one (such
as the \(R\) relation), define a logical wrapper for it that uses the
appropriate class inside.
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{\modulo}{}{%
  \mathbin{\%}%
}
\( 17 \modulo 3 = 2 \)
\end{example}

\subsection{Manual Spacing}

If the spacing within formulae chosen by \LaTeX{} is not satisfactory, it can
be adjusted manually. The most basic command to do so is
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{mspace}[width: m]
\end{lscommand}
The \carg{width} is specified using a special unit \enquote{\unit{mu}}, which
is roughly equal to \sfrac{1}{18} of the width of letter \enquote{M} in the
current math font.\footnote{Units are explained in more detail in
  \autoref{sec:dimensions}.}
\begin{example}
\( 1 \mspace{18mu} 2 \)
\\ %!hide
\textinterrobang{} vs.\
\( ? \mspace{-7mu} ! \)
\end{example}
There also exist predefined synonyms for the values most commonly used. These
are presented in \autoref{tbl:math_space} and are usually sufficient when
creating a document.
\begin{table}
  \ExplSyntaxOn
  \NewDocumentCommand{\ShowSpace}{m}{\(\rightarrow \mspace{-2mu} #1 \leftarrow\)}
  \ExplSyntaxOff
  \caption{Commands for manual math spacing}\label{tbl:math_space}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    \toprule
    Command             & Alias   & Equivalent to                        & Effect                     \\
    \midrule
    \emph{none}         &         &                                      & \ShowSpace{}               \\[0.5em]
    \csi{thinspace}     & \csi{,} & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{3mu}|  & \ShowSpace{\thinspace}     \\
    \csi{medspace}      & \csi{:} & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{4mu}|  & \ShowSpace{\medspace}      \\
    \csi{thickspace}    & \csi{;} & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{5mu}|  & \ShowSpace{\thickspace}    \\
    \csi{quad}          &         & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{18mu}| & \ShowSpace{\quad}          \\
    \csi{qquad}         &         & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{36mu}| & \ShowSpace{\qquad}         \\[0.5em]
    \csi{negthinspace}  & \csi{!} & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{-3mu}| & \ShowSpace{\negthinspace}  \\
    \csi{negmedspace}   &         & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{-4mu}| & \ShowSpace{\negmedspace}   \\
    \csi{negthickspace} &         & \mintinline{latex}|\mathspace{-5mu}| & \ShowSpace{\negthickspace} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
For example, if you wanted to define the \enquote{d} in differentials, you may
want to insert a small space behind it to separate it from the contents of the
integral.
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{\ud}{}{%
  \,\symrm{d}%
}
\[
  \int_a^b f(x)\ud x 
\]
\end{example}

The negative spaces can also be used if you want to create your own
mathematical symbols by overlaying existing ones.
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{\myrel}{}{
  \mathrel{
    -\mspace{-11mu}
    \infty{}
    \mspace{-11mu}-
  }
}
\( x \myrel y \)
\end{example}

\subsection{Phantoms}

In some situations it may be useful to insert the space that would normally be
occupied by some existing symbol. While you could eyeball it and insert
appropriate \csi{mspace}, there is a better way to do so---phantoms. There are
three commands for inserting phantoms.
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{phantom}[text: m] \\
  \csi{vphantom}[text: m] \\
  \csi{hphantom}[text: m]
\end{lscommand}
Each of them typesets an invisible box that has dimensions equal to the text
that it received as an argument. The \csi{vphantom} has zero width, while the
\csi{hphantom} has zero height.

For example, when creating left superscripts and subscripts, they will be
aligned to the left, since they actually apply to the previous (empty) symbol.
A simple fix would be to pad the space using appropriate phantom. In real world
it would be better to use the \csi{prescript} from the \pai{mathtools} package.
\begin{example}
\( {}^{14}_{6}A \) vs.\
\( \prescript{14}{6}A \) vs.\
\( {}^{14}_{\phantom{1}6}A \)
\end{example}
Left superscripts and subscripts are often found in chemistry, when typesetting
isotopes. If you intend to use \LaTeX{} for that, it is better to use a
dedicated package, such as \pai*{chemformula} or \pai*{mhchem}.

The \csi{vphantom} is useful if you want to typeset a formula which uses
extending delimiters over multiple lines, since they only work with a single
line formulae inside them. Using that command we can artificially increase the
height of the subformula, so the height of the delimiters will be calculated
correctly.
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{\ud}{}{\,\symrm{d}} %!hide
\begin{multline*}
  f(a, b) = \left(
    \int_a^b f(x)
    loooooong
  \right. \\
  \left.
    \vphantom{
      \int_a^b f(x)
      loooooong
    }
    short \ud x
  \right)
\end{multline*}
\end{example}

\section{Fiddling with Math Styles}\label{sec:fontsz}

You have already seen that \LaTeX{} typesets mathematics different, based on
whether it is in inline or display style. There are actually four styles, the
additional two being typically used for sup- and subscripts. If you want to
change the style chosen by \LaTeX{} you can do so by using the commands
presented in \autoref{tbl:math_styles}.
\begin{table}
  \NewDocumentCommand{\mathipsum}{}{\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} ABCabc123}
  \ExplSyntaxOn
  \NewDocumentCommand{\ShowStyle}{m}{
    \csi{#1} & \(\use:c{#1} \mathipsum \)
  }
  \ExplSyntaxOff
  \caption{Math style commands available in \LaTeX{}}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \toprule
    Command & Example             \\
    \midrule
    \ShowStyle{displaystyle}      \\
    \ShowStyle{textstyle}         \\
    \ShowStyle{scriptstyle}       \\
    \ShowStyle{scriptscriptstyle} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \csi{frac} command by default decreases the style of its contents by one
level when possible.
\begin{example}
\[
  \frac
    {\frac
      {\frac{1}{2}}
      {2}}
    {2}
\]
\end{example}
If you want to prevent it, use the appropriate command in its arguments.
\begin{example}
\[
\frac
  {\displaystyle
   \sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - x)^2}
  {\displaystyle
   \left(
    \sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - x)
   \right)^2}
\]
\end{example}

When typesetting formulae within text, you may enclose tall or deep math
expressions or sub expressions in \csi{smash}. This makes \LaTeX{} ignore the
height of these expressions and keeps the line spacing even, but risks
overlapping the text around them.
\begin{example}
A \(d_{e_{e_p}}\) mathematical
expression followed by a
\(h^{i^{g^h}}\) expression.
As opposed to a smashed 
\smash{\(d_{e_{e_p}}\)}
expression followed by a
\smash{\(h^{i^{g^h}}\)}
expression.
\end{example}

The \csi{smash} command accepts an optional argument---either \cargv{t} or
\cargv{b}---that only changes the height of top and bottom parts of symbol to
zero. This may be useful in some rare circumstances, for example when adjacent
radical symbols don't line up due to differing content heights.
\begin{example}
\(  \sqrt{x} 
  + \sqrt{y} 
  + \sqrt{z}\)
vs.\
\(  \sqrt{x} 
  + \sqrt{\smash[b]{y}} 
  + \sqrt{z} \)
\end{example}

\section{Theorems and Proofs}

When writing mathematical documents, you probably need a way to typeset
\enquote{Lemmas}, \enquote{Definitions}, \enquote{Axioms} and similar
structures. These are known as \emph{theorems} in \LaTeX{} and can be created
using the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{newtheorem}[name:m, counter:o, caption:m, section:o]
\end{lscommand}
command. The \carg{name} argument is name of the newly created environment used
to typeset the theorem. The \carg{caption} argument defines the actual name,
which will be printed in the final document.

The optional arguments are both used to specify the numbering used on the
\enquote{theorem}. Only one of them may be present. Use the \carg{counter}
argument to specify the \carg{name} of a previously declared \enquote{theorem}.
This will make the new theorem to be numbered the same way as the old one. The
\carg{section} argument allows you to specify the sectional unit within which
the theorem should get its numbers. The starred version of the command defines
a theorem without a counter.

After executing the \csi{newtheorem} command in the preamble of your document,
you can use the following environment within the document.
\begin{minted}{latex}
\begin{«\carg{name}»}[«\carg{title}»]
This is my interesting theorem
\end{«\carg{name}»}
\end{minted}
The optional \carg{title} argument can be used to locally typeset the theorem
name next to the caption.
\begin{example}[standalone, paperheight=4cm]
\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}
% ...
\begin{document} %!hide
\begin{proposition}
  I propose that this should 
  be enough of dummy text.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}[More]
  It is not enough for more
  than one proposition.
\end{proposition}
\end{document}%!hide
\end{example}

The \pai*{amsthm} package provides the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{theoremstyle}[style: m]
\end{lscommand}
command which lets you further customise a theorem by picking from three
predefined styles: \cargv{definition} (bold title, roman body), \cargv{plain}
(bold title, italic body) or \cargv{remark} (italic title, roman body). An
example of using these commands is presented in \autoref{lst:theorems}
\begin{listing}
  \begin{lined}{\textwidth}
    \begin{example}[standalone, paperheight=6cm]
\usepackage{amsthm}

\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{axiom}{Axiom}[section]
\theoremstyle{plain}
\newtheorem{theorem}[axiom]{Theorem}
\theoremstyle{remark}
\newtheorem*{remark}{Remark}
% ...
\begin{document} %!hide
\section{First}
\begin{axiom}[Uncertainty]
  Nothing is certain.
\end{axiom}
\begin{theorem}
  It is uncertain whether
  this theorem is true.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}[Other things]
  Other things are
  probably also uncertain.
\end{remark}
\end{document}%!hide
\end{example}
  \end{lined}
  \caption{An example of creating several theorem environments with different
    styles.}\label{lst:theorems}
\end{listing}

If you want to customise your theorems down to the last dot, the
\pai*{ntheorem} package offers a plethora of options.

The \pai{amsthm} package also provides the \ei{proof} environment to use with theorems.
\begin{example}
\begin{proof}
  Trivial.
\end{proof}
\end{example}
The QED symbol (\(\qedsymbol\)) is put at the end of the last line in the
environment. This may create unnecessary lines if the proof does not end with a
paragraph.
\begin{example}
\begin{proof}
  Trivial, use
  \[ E=mc^2. \]
\end{proof}
\end{example}
You can adjust its placement using the \csi{qedhere} command.
\begin{example}
\begin{proof}
 Trivial, use
 \[ E=mc^2. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}
\end{example}

If you do not like the default symbol you can redefine the \csi{qedsymbol}
macro to your liking.
\begin{example}
\RenewDocumentCommand{%
  \qedsymbol}{}{QED}
\begin{proof}
  Trivial.
\end{proof}
\RenewDocumentCommand{%
  \qedsymbol}{}{\(\QED\)}
\begin{proof}
  Trivial.
\end{proof}
\end{example}

\section{More About Fractions}\label{sec:fractions}

You have already learned about the \csi{frac} command for typesetting built-up
fractions. Its output depends on whether it is typeset in display or text
style.
\begin{example}
\(\frac{1}{2}\) vs.\
\[\frac{1}{2}\]
\end{example}

If you don't want to type \csi{displaystyle} or \csi{textstyle} every time to
correct the style of fractions you can use \csi{tfrac} and \csi{dfrac}. These
always typeset the fractions in text or display style, respectively.
\begin{example}
\(\dfrac{1}{2}\) vs.\
\(\tfrac{1}{2}\)
\[\dfrac{1}{2}\text{ vs.\ }
  \tfrac{1}{2}\]
\end{example}

When writing the fractions in-line, often the slashed form \(1/2\) is
preferable for small fractions. You may also want to use the \pai*{xfrac}
package and the \csi{sfrac} command it provides to typeset them in a slashed
form with smaller numbers.
\begin{example}
\(\frac{1}{2}\) vs.\ \(1/2\)
vs.\ \sfrac{1}{2} vs.\ ½
\end{example}
Note that the \csi{sfrac} essentially \enquote*{fakes} the fraction by manually
placing relevant symbols in the given positions. If the faked version is not to
your liking, the package provides more customisation options. These are
described in the package documentation. Some fonts support arbitrary fractions
as symbols, which may produce better results; you can find more information
about it in the \autoref{sec:fontspec}.

If you have tried writing continued fractions, you may have noticed that the
spacing is not ideal. The \pai{amsmath} package defines a special \csi{cfrac}
command to fix this issue.
\begin{example}
\[
  \dfrac{1}{
    1 + \dfrac{1}{
      1 + \dfrac{1}{
        1 + \dotsb}}}
\]
vs.\
\[
  \cfrac{1}{
    1 + \cfrac{1}{
      1 + \cfrac{1}{
        1 + \dotsb}}}
\]
\end{example}

Binomial coefficients can be typeset using the \csi{binom}, \csi{tbinom} and
\csi{dbinom} commands. These work analogously to the \csi{frac}, \csi{tfrac}
and \csi{dfrac} commands.
\begin{example}
\[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}
    = 2^{n}
\]
\end{example}

The built-up fractions and binomial coefficients are specialised examples of a
more general command called \csi{genfrac}. It allows you to typeset one
expression over another with an optional line between them and delimiters. Its
full syntax is
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{genfrac}[left:m, right:m, thickness:m, style: m, num:m, den: m]
\end{lscommand}
The \carg{left} and \carg{right} arguments are left and right delimiters, such
as parentheses in the case of \csi{binom}. The \carg{thickness} determines the
thickness of the line between the expressions, if you leave it empty it
defaults to the same as this used by \csi{frac}. The \carg{style} is a number
from \(0\) to \(3\) and overrides the default math style used to typeset the
symbol, for example, the \csi{tfrac} sets it to \(1\) to always typeset the
symbol in text style.

For example, to create a wrapper for the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first
kind you could write
\begin{chktexignore}  
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{\stirfst}{}{
  \genfrac{[}{]}{0cm}{}
}
\[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \stirfst{n}{k}
    = n!
\]
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}
You should avoid using \csi{genfrac} inside the body of the document and always
define logical wrappers if you intend to use it in multiple places.
