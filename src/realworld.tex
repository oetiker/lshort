\chapter{Real World \LaTeX{}}\label{chap:realworld}

\begin{intro}
  After reading the previous chapter, you should have some general idea
  about \LaTeX{}. This chapter
  will fill in the remaining structure you will need to know in order
  to produce real world documents.
\end{intro}

\section{The Layout of the Document}

\subsection{Document Classes}\label{sec:documentclass}

The first information \LaTeX{} needs to know when processing an
input file is the type of document the author wants to create. This
is specified with the \csi{documentclass} command.
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{documentclass}[options:o, class: m]
\end{lscommand}
Here \carg{class} specifies the type of document to be created.
\autoref{documentclasses} lists some of the available document classes. The
\carg{\wi{option}s} parameter customises the behaviour of the document class.
The options have to be separated by commas. The most common options for the
standard document classes are listed in \autoref{options}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Document Classes.}\label{documentclasses}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lp{8cm}@{}}
    \toprule
    Class         & Description                                       \\
    \midrule
    \cli{article} & for articles in
    scientific journals, short reports, and any other short document. \\
    \cli{proc}    & a class for
    proceedings based on the article class.                           \\
    \cli{report}  & for longer reports.
    containing several chapters, small books, PhD theses, \ldots      \\
    \cli{book}    & for real books.                                   \\
    \cli{beamer}  & for presentations.                                \\
    \cli{letter}  & for letters.                                      \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
  \RenewDocumentCommand{\arraystretch}{}{1.2}
  \caption{Document Class Options.}\label{options}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}>{\RaggedRight}p{2.5cm}p{9cm}@{}}
    \toprule
    Options                                  & Description                   \\
    \midrule
    \cargv{10pt}, \cargv{11pt}, \cargv{12pt} & Sets the size
    of the main font in the document. If no option is specified,
    \cargv{10pt} is assumed.\index{document font size}\index{base
    font size}                                                               \\
    \cargv{a4paper}, \cargv{letterpaper}     & Defines the paper size.
    The default size can be configured when installing \LaTeX. Besides that,
    \cargv{a5paper}, \cargv{b5paper}, \cargv{executivepaper}, and
    \cargv{legalpaper} can be specified.\index{legal paper}\index{paper
      size}\index{A4 paper}\index{letter paper}\index{A5 paper}\index{B5
    paper}\index{executive paper}                                            \\
    \cargv{fleqn}                            & Typesets
    displayed formulae left-aligned instead of centred.                      \\
    \cargv{leqno}                            & Places
    the numbering of formulae on the left hand side instead of the right.    \\
    \cargv{titlepage}, \cargv{notitlepage}   & Specifies
    whether a new page should be started after the \wi{document title}
    or not. The \cargv{article} class does not start a new page by
    default, while \cargv{report} and \cargv{book} do.\index{title}          \\
    \cargv{onecolumn}, \cargv{twocolumn}     & Instructs
    \LaTeX{} to typeset the document in \wi{one column} or \wi{two column}s. \\
    \cargv{twoside, oneside}                 & Specifies whether
    double or single sided output should be generated. The classes
    \cargv{article} and \cargv{report} are \wi{single sided} and the
    \cargv{book} class is \wi{double sided} by default. Note that this
    option concerns the style of the document only. The option
    \cargv{twoside} does \emph{not} tell the printer you use that it
    should actually make a two-sided printout.                               \\
    \cargv{landscape}                        & Changes the
    layout of the document to print in landscape mode.                       \\
    \cargv{openright, openany}               & Makes chapters begin
    either only on right hand pages or on the next page available. This does
    not work with the \cargv{article} class, as it does not know about
    chapters. The \cargv{report} class by default starts chapters on
    the next page available and the \cargv{book} class starts them on
    right hand pages.                                                        \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For example if an input file for a \LaTeX{} document starts with the
line
\begin{code}
\csi{documentclass}[{11pt, twoside, a4paper}: vo, article: vm]
\end{code}
then it instructs \LaTeX{} to typeset the document as an article
with a base font size of eleven points, and to produce a
layout suitable for double sided printing on A4 paper.

\subsection{Page Styles}

\LaTeX{} supports three predefined \wi{header}/\wi{footer}
combinations---so-called \wi{page style}s. The \emph{style} parameter
of the\index{page style!plain@\texttt{plain}}\index{plain@\texttt{plain}}\index{page
  style!headings@\texttt{headings}}\index{headings@\texttt{headings}}\index{page
  style!empty@\texttt{empty}}\index{empty@\texttt{empty}}
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{pagestyle}[style: m]
\end{lscommand}
command defines which one to use. \autoref{pagestyle} lists the predefined
page styles.

\begin{table}
  \caption{The Predefined Page Styles of \LaTeX.}\label{pagestyle}
  \begin{tabular}{lp{8cm}}
    \toprule
    Style              & Description                                      \\
    \midrule
    \cargv{plain}      & prints the page numbers on the bottom
    of the page, in the middle of the footer. This is the default page
    style.                                                                \\
    \cargv{headings}   & prints the current chapter heading
    and the page number in the header on each page, while the footer
    remains empty.  (This is the style used in this document)             \\
    \cargv{empty}      & sets both the header and the footer
    to be empty.                                                          \\
    \cargv{myheadings} & similar to the \cargv{headings} style but leaves
    the headers and footers empty allowing for them to be defined by
    the author. A description of how to do this is in
    \autoref{sec:fancy}.                                                  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

It is possible to change the page style of the current page with the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{thispagestyle}[style: m]
\end{lscommand}

You may also control the style of the displayed page numbers. To change it use
the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{pagenumbering}[style: m]
\end{lscommand}
command, where \carg{style} is one of the styles presented in
\autoref{tb:numberings}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Possible argument of the \csi{pagenumbering} command.}\label{tb:numberings}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \toprule
    Style          & Description                                   \\
    \midrule
    \cargv{arabic} & Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, \ldots)             \\
    \cargv{roman}  & Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, \ldots) \\
    \cargv{Roman}  & Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, \ldots) \\
    \cargv{alph}   & Lowercase Latin letters (a, b, c, \ldots)     \\
    \cargv{Alph}   & Uppercase Latin letters (A, B, C, \ldots)     \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

A description how to create your own headers and footers can be found in
\autoref{sec:fancy} on \autopageref{sec:fancy}.

\section{Line Breaking and Page Breaking}

\subsection{Justified Paragraphs}

Books are often typeset with each line having the same length.
\LaTeX{} inserts the necessary \wi{line break}s and spaces between words
by optimising the contents of a whole paragraph. If necessary, it
also hyphenates words that would not fit comfortably on a line.
How the paragraphs are typeset depends on the document class.
Normally the first line of a paragraph is indented, and there is no
additional space between two paragraphs. Refer to \autoref{parsp}
for more information.

In special cases it might be necessary to order \LaTeX{} to break a
line:
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{\bs}[length:o] or \csi{newline}
\end{lscommand}
starts a new line without starting a new paragraph. The optional \carg{length}
argument adds additional space after the line.

\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{\bs*}[length:o]
\end{lscommand}
additionally prohibits a page break after the forced line break.

\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{newpage}
\end{lscommand}
starts a new page.

\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{linebreak}[n:o] \\
  \csi{nolinebreak}[n:o] \\
  \csi{pagebreak}[n:o] \\
  \csi{nopagebreak}[n:o]
\end{lscommand}
suggest places where a break may (or may not) happen.
They enable the author to influence their
actions with the optional argument \emph{n}, which can be set to a number
between zero and four. By setting \emph{n} to a value below 4, you leave
\LaTeX{} the option of ignoring your command if the result would look very
bad. Do not confuse these ``break'' commands with the ``new'' commands. Even
when you give a ``break'' command, \LaTeX{} still tries to even out the
right border of the line and the total length of the page, as described in
the next section; this can lead to unpleasant gaps in your text.
If you really want to start a ``new line'' or a ``new page'', then use the
corresponding command. Guess their names!
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.4\linewidth]
  Start a new line here,\\
  and also here but make
  it bigger.\\[1cm]
  Do a linebreak here\linebreak
  and maybe here, \linebreak[1]
  but no pressure.
  Linebreak here\linebreak[3]
  would be \emph{really} cool. 
\end{example}

\LaTeX{} always tries to produce the best line breaks possible. If it
cannot find a way to break the lines in a manner that meets its high
standards, it lets one line stick out on the right of the paragraph.
\LaTeX{} then complains (``\wi{overfull hbox}'') while processing the
input file. This happens most often when \LaTeX{} cannot find a
suitable place to hyphenate a word.\footnote{Although \LaTeX{} gives
  you a warning when that happens (\texttt{Overfull \bs{}hbox}) and displays the
  offending line, such lines are not always easy to find. If you use
  the option \texttt{draft} in the \csi{documentclass} command, these
  lines will be marked with a thick black line on the right margin.}
Instruct \LaTeX{} to lower its standards a little by giving
the \csi{sloppy} command. It prevents such over-long lines by
increasing the inter-word spacing---even if the final output is not
optimal.  In this case a warning (``\wi{underfull hbox}'') is given to
the user.  In most such cases the result doesn't look very good. The
command \csi{fussy} brings \LaTeX{} back to its default behaviour.

\subsection{Hyphenation}\label{hyph}

\LaTeX{} hyphenates words whenever necessary. If the hyphenation
algorithm does not find the correct hyphenation points,
remedy the situation by using the following commands to tell \TeX{}
about the exception.

The command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{hyphenation}[word list: m]
\end{lscommand}
causes the words listed in the argument to be hyphenated only at the points
marked by \enquote*{\texttt{-}}.  The argument of the command should only contain
words built from normal letters, or rather signs that are considered to be
normal letters by \LaTeX{}. The hyphenation hints are stored for the language
that is active when the hyphenation command occurs. This means that if you
place a hyphenation command into the preamble of your document it will
influence the English language hyphenation. If you place the command after the
\begin{chktexignore}
  \mintinline{latex}|\begin{document}|
\end{chktexignore}
and you are using some package for national language
support like \pai{polyglossia}, then the hyphenation hints will be active in
the language activated through \pai{polyglossia}.

The example below will allow the word \enquote{locomotion} to be hyphenated as
well as \enquote{Locomotion}, and it prevents \enquote{FORTRAN},
\enquote{Fortran} and \enquote{fortran} from being hyphenated at all.  No
special characters or symbols are allowed in the argument.
\begin{code}
\csi{hyphenation}[FORTRAN Lo-co-mo-tion:vm]
\end{code}

The command \csi{-} inserts a discretionary hyphen into a word. This also
becomes the only point hyphenation is allowed in this word. This command is
especially useful for words containing special characters, because \LaTeX{}
does not automatically hyphenate words containing special characters.
\begin{example}
I think this is: su\-per\-%
cal\-i\-frag\-i\-lis\-tic\-%
ex\-pi\-al\-i\-do\-cious
\end{example}

Several words can be kept together on one line with the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{mbox}[text: m]
\end{lscommand}
\noindent It causes its argument to be kept together under all circumstances.

\begin{example}
My phone number will
change soon. It will
be \mbox{0116 291 2319}.

The parameter
\mbox{[filename]} should
contain the name of the file.
\end{example}

\section{Ready-Made Strings}

In some of the examples on the previous pages, you have seen
some very simple \LaTeX{} commands for typesetting special
text strings:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
    \toprule
    Command      & Example   & Description               \\
    \midrule
    \csi{today}  & \today    & Current date              \\
    \csi{TeX}    & \TeX{}    & Your favourite typesetter \\
    \csi{LaTeX}  & \LaTeX{}  & The Name of the Game      \\
    \csi{LaTeXe} & \LaTeXe{} & The current incarnation   \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Dashes and Hyphens}

\LaTeX{} knows four kinds of \wi{dash}es. Access three of them with different
number of consecutive dashes. The fourth sign is actually not a dash at
all---it is the mathematical minus sign. It is typed automatically when inside
math mode which is described later in \autoref{chap:math}.
\begin{example}
daughter-in-law, X-rated\\
pages 13--67\\
yes---or no?
\end{example}

The names for these dashes are: `-' \wi{hyphen}\index{-}, `--'
\wi{en-dash}\index{--} and `---' \wi{em-dash}\index{---}. Hyphens are used when
writing compound words (and inserted automatically by \LaTeX{} when splitting a
single words), en-dashes are used for writing a range of numbers and em-dashes
are used to mark an interruption in speech or an abrupt change of thought.

\section{Slash (/)}\index{Slash}

In order to typeset a slash between two words, one can simply type for example
\texttt{read/write}, but this makes \LaTeX{} treat the two words as one.
Hyphenation is disabled for these two words, so there may be
\enquote*{overfull} errors.  To overcome this, use \csi{slash}.  For example
type
\begin{code}
  \mintinline{latex}|read\slash write|
\end{code}
which allows hyphenation.  Normal
\enquote*{\texttt{/}} character may be still used for inline fractions.
Typesetting units, such as \unit[per-mode = symbol]{\mebi\byte\per\s}, will be
described in \autoref{sec:units}.

\section{The Euro Currency Symbol \texorpdfstring{(\officialeuro)}{}}

When writing about money these days, you need the Euro symbol. Many current
fonts contain a Euro symbol. To typeset it use the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{texteuro}
\end{lscommand}

If your font does not provide its own Euro symbol or if you do not like the
font's Euro symbol, you have two more choices:

First the \pai{eurosym} package. It provides the official Euro symbol:
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{usepackage}[official: vo, eurosym: m]
\end{lscommand}
If you prefer a Euro symbol that matches your font, use the option
\texttt{gen} in place of the \texttt{official} option. Comparison of the
available Euro symbols can be fount in \autoref{eurosymb}.

\begin{table}
  \caption[Available Euro symbols]{The appearance of available Euro symbols based
    on the loaded package and the used font.}\label{eurosymb}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}llccc@{}}
    \toprule
                   &                               & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Symbol used}                                             \\
    \cmidrule(l){3-5}

    \midrule
    \emph{none}    & \csi{texteuro}                & \huge\texteuro{}                & \huge\sffamily\texteuro{}
                   & \huge\ttfamily\texteuro{}                                                                                   \\
    eurosym        & \csi{euro}                    & \huge\officialeuro{}            & \huge\sffamily\officialeuro{}
                   & \huge\ttfamily\officialeuro{}                                                                               \\
    {[gen]eurosym} & \csi{euro}                    & \huge\geneuro{}                 & \huge\sffamily\geneuro{}
                   & \huge\ttfamily\geneuro{}                                                                                    \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \medskip
\end{table}

\section{Ellipsis (\ldots)}

On a typewriter, a \wi{comma} or a \wi{period} takes the same amount of
space as any other letter. In book printing, these characters occupy
only a little space and are set very close to the preceding letter.
Therefore, entering \enquote*{\wi{ellipsis}} by just typing three
dots would produce the wrong result. Instead, there is a special
command for these dots. It is called
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{ldots} (low dots)\index{...@\ldots}
\end{lscommand}

\begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}
Not like this ...
but like this:\\
New York, Tokyo,
Budapest, \ldots
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

\section{Ligatures}

Some letter combinations are typeset not just by setting the
different letters one after the other, but by actually using special
symbols.
\begin{code}
{\large ff fi fl ffi \ldots}\quad
instead of\quad {\large f\mbox{}f f\mbox{}i f\mbox{}l f\mbox{}f\mbox{}i \ldots}
\end{code}
These so-called \wi{ligature}s can be prohibited by inserting an \mintinline{latex}|\mbox{}|
between the two letters in question. This might be necessary with
words built from two words.

\begin{example}
\Large %!hide
Not shelfful\\
but shelf\mbox{}ful
\end{example}

\section{Abstract}

In scientific publications it is customary to start with an abstract which
gives the reader a quick overview of what to expect. \LaTeX{} provides the
\ei{abstract} environment for this purpose. Normally \ei{abstract} is used
in documents typeset with the article document class.

\begin{example}[standalone, paperheight=3.5cm]
\begin{document}%!hide
\begin{abstract}
  This paper will talk about
  abstracts.
\end{abstract}

Abstracts are very important \ldots
\end{document}%!hide
\end{example}

\subsection{Accents and Special Characters}

\LaTeX{} supports the use of \wi{accent}s and \wi{special character}s
from many languages. \autoref{accents} shows all sorts of accents
being applied to the letter o. Naturally other letters work too.

To place an accent on top of an i or a j, its dots have to be
removed. This is accomplished by typing \csi{i} and \csi{j}.
\begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}
H\^otel, na\"\i ve, \'el\`eve,\\
sm\o rrebr\o d, !`Se\~norita!,\\
Sch\"onbrunner Schlo\ss{}
Stra\ss e
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

\section{Simple Commands}\label{sec:simple_commands}

Oftentimes when writing a document you will find yourself typing the same
name\slash{}logo\slash{}complicated text in multiple places. If that's the case
you risk introducing typos in these. In case of brand logos it is also often
the case that they define a preferred way to introduce them in text, such as
all uppercase or starting with a lowercase letter even at the beginning of the
sentence.

We have already seen a solution for this problem---commands. For example to
refer to \LaTeX{}, which uses a rather complicated logo within text, you don't
have to put pictures or manually space letters---just use the \csi{LaTeX}
command. In \LaTeX{} you can define your own commands that may replace
complicated sequence of commands producing given text.

For example, let's imagine that you are writing an article about Polish
notation. In doing so, you may have to refer to the the inventor of the
notation, Jan Łukasiewicz. His last name may not be easy to remember and to
type for someone who does not speak Polish. It also starts with letter
\enquote*{Ł} which may not be easily accessible on your keyboard, so you will
have to use \csi{L} which will make the code less readable.

\LaTeX{} enables you to define your own commands using the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{NewDocumentCommand}[name:M, {{}}:c, definition:m]
\end{lscommand}
command. The \carg{name} is the name of the command that you will use in the
code, while the \carg{definition} is the output it will produce. The second
argument is left empty for now but will be explored in
\autoref{sec:new_commands}
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{\lukas}{}{%
  Łukasiewicz%
}

Polish notation (also known as
\lukas{} notation, due to its
inventor, Jan \lukas) is a
mathematical notation \ldots{}
\end{example}
In the example above we have used \ai{\%} comments to avoid introducing spaces.
If you need a refresher on this technique, refer to \autoref{sec:comments}.

While the \enquote*{Ł} character is available in \LaTeX{} using the \csi{L}
command, this is not the case for all unicode characters. For example, the
default font contains a glyph for commercial minus sign (⁒), used in some German
speaking countries, but does not define a command to enter it. If you want to
avoid copy-pasting it into your code constantly you can set up a command to
typeset it for you.
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{%
  \comminus}{}{⁒}

Now I can type ⁒ or \comminus.
\end{example}

Yet another usage is to define a command for a simple string, but one you may
want to change later. For example, let's image you are writing a novel, but are
not so sure about your protagonist name. You can define a command for
typesetting it, and in case of changing your name you will be able to modify it
in one place instead of hunting down every single instance of their name
throughout the book.
\begin{example}
\NewDocumentCommand{%
  \hero}{}{Launcelot}

\hero{} unsheathed his sword.
He  had a bad feeling about
this place from the start.
\end{example}

The \csi{NewDocumentCommand} checks if a command with the given name is already
defined and raises an error if it does. This means that you can freely use it
to define your own commands without worrying about breaking some internal
commands used by \LaTeX{} or used packages. But sometimes redefining existing
commands is actually what you want, for example, many packages allow for
customisation in that way. In that case you should use
\csi{RenewDocumentCommand}. It works the same way as the former command, but it
raises error if a command with the given name is \emph{not} already defined.
\begin{example}
\RenewDocumentCommand{%
  \ldots}{}{...}

I like my ellipsis looking
uglier \ldots
\end{example}

The presented commands can be used with nearly all features of \LaTeX{}. While
here we have only dealt with text, the commands may be used to insert pictures
or mathematical notations. It is especially useful for the latter case, since
mathematical symbols are often repurposed to mean different things and
consistency of their usage is very important.

Note that the described commands are actually much more powerful and will be
discussed further in \autoref{sec:new_commands}.

\section{International Language Support}\label{sec:polyglossia}%
\index{international}
\secby{Axel Kielhorn}{A.Kielhorn@web.de}

When you write documents in \wi{language}s
other than English, there are three areas where \LaTeX{} has to be
configured appropriately:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All automatically generated text strings (\enquote{Table of Contents},
        \enquote{List of Figures}, \ldots) have to be adapted to the new language.
  \item \LaTeX{} needs to know the hyphenation rules for the current language.
  \item Language specific typographic rules. In French for example, there is a
        mandatory space before each colon character (:).
\end{enumerate}

Also entering text in your language of choice might be a bit cumbersome using
all the commands from \autoref{accents}. To overcome this problem, until
recently you had to delve deep into the abyss of language specific encodings
both for input as well as fonts. These days, with modern \TeX{} engines
speaking UTF-8 natively, these problems have relaxed considerably.

The package \pai*{polyglossia} is a replacement for the venerable \pai{babel}
package. It takes care of the hyphenation patterns and automatically generated
text strings in your documents. Polyglossia works only with \hologo{XeTeX}
and \hologo{LuaTeX} engines.

\subsection{Polyglossia Usage}

So far there has been no advantage to using a Unicode \hologo{TeX} engine. This
changes when we leave English and move to a language that uses non-Latin
alphabet like Greek or Russian. With a Unicode based system, you can
simply\footnote{For small values of simple.} enter the native characters in
your editor and \hologo{TeX} will understand them.

Writing in different languages is easy, just load the \pai{polyglossia} package
and specify the languages in the preamble using
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{setdefaultlanguage}[options: o, language: m] \\
  \csi{setotherlanguage}[options: o, language: m]
\end{lscommand}
where \carg{language} is either the name of the language to use such as
\cargv{gaelic} or \cargv{japanese}, or its BCP-47 tag such as \cargv{de-CH} or
\cargv{ru-luna1918}. When specifying language via its name you may pass
additional \carg{options} to decide between its variants for example
\cargv{variant=british} or \cargv{script=Arabic}. Note that when loading a
language, either via tag or with options, all variants are loaded and the
tag\slash{}options specified are just the defaults. For a full list of supported
languages and variants see the \pai{polyglossia} package documentation.

To write a paragraph in German, you can use the \ei{german} environment:

\begin{example}
%!showbegin !hide
% In the preamble
\setdefaultlanguage{english}
\setotherlanguage{german}
% ...
%!showend !hide
\year=3022 \month=1 \day=19 %!hide
Today is not \today.

\begin{german}
  Heute ist nicht \today.
\end{german}
\end{example}

You may also use \ei{lang} environment that accepts the \carg{language} as its
first argument. This is especially useful if you prefer to specify the language
via BCP-47 tag since environment names cannot contain the
\enquote*{\texttt{-}} symbol.
\begin{example}
\year=3022 \month=1 \day=19 %!hide
\begin{lang}{de-AT}
  Heute ist nicht \today.
\end{lang}
\end{example}

You can also pass \carg{options} as an optional argument to the environment.
\begin{example}
\year=3023 \month=8 \day=17 %!hide
\begin{german}[
  script=blackletter
]
  Heute ist nicht \today.
\end{german}
\end{example}

If you just need a word or a short phrase in a foreign language you can use
either the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{text«\bs carg*{language}»}[options:o, text:m]
\end{lscommand}
or the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{textlang}[options:o, language:m, text:m]
\end{lscommand}
command:
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
In Austria they write
\textlang[variant=austrian]{de}{Jänner}
instead of \textgerman{Januar}. And in the olden
days \textlang{de}{August} was written
\textgerman[script=blackletter]{Auguſt}.
\end{example}

For languages that are not very different from English, the results are not
very impressive. We get correct hyphenation and some context aware commands
such as \csi{today} adjust their output. However the further we stray from
English, the more useful will this commands become.

Sometimes the font used in the main document does not contain glyphs that are
required in the second language. The default Latin Modern font for example does not
contain Cyrillic letters. The solution is to define a custom font that will be used
for that language.

To set the fonts use the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{newfontfamily}[familyname:M, options:o, font:m]
\end{lscommand}
from the \pai{fontspec} package\footnote{\pai{fontspec} is loaded automatically
  by \pai{polyglossia} so you do not need to add it to a the preamble of your
  document.} which is described in much more detail in
\autoref{sec:fontspec}.

When changing the text language, \pai{polyglossia} checks whether a font family named
\cargv{\textit{language}font} exists and changes to it if it's available.

If you are happy with the default Latin Modern font, you may want to try the \enquote{CMU} font
which contains some additional Cyrillic or Greek glyphs
while looking nearly identical to Latin Modern.\footnote{Both fonts are
  actually based on the Computer Modern font, designed by Donald Knuth for
  the first \TeX{} versions.}

If you have the CMU font installed in your system (unlikely) or you are using
\hologo{LuaLaTeX} then you can simply write
\begin{minted}{latex}
  \newfontfamily\greekfont{CMU Serif}
\end{minted}

If you are using \hologo{XeLaTeX} and don't have the font installed then you
need to specify the font by its file name.
\begin{minted}{latex}
  \newfontfamily\greekfont[
    Extension=.otf, UprightFont=*rm, ItalicFont=*ti,
    BoldFont=*bx, BoldItalicFont=*bi,
  ]{Cm}
\end{minted}

With the appropriate fonts loaded, you can now write:
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode,noextend]
%!showbegin !hide
% In the preamble (LuaLaTeX)
\setotherlanguage{greek}
\newfontfamily\greekfont{CMU Serif}
\setotherlanguage{russian}
\newfontfamily\russianfont{CMU Serif}
% ...
%!showend !hide

\begin{chktexignore} %!hide
\textrussian{Правда} is a Russian newspaper. %!hide
\textlang{greek}{ἀλήθεια} is truth or disclosure in %!hide
%!showbegin %!hide
\textrussian{«\fontspec{cmuntt.otf}Правда»} is a Russian newspaper.
\textlang{greek}{«\fontspec{cmuntt.otf}ἀλήθεια»} is truth or disclosure in
%!showend %!hide
philosophy.
\end{chktexignore} %!hide
\end{example}

\LaTeX{} actually uses three different fonts for typesetting documents. The
above commands only set the default serif font used for the body text. The
other fonts are \textsf{sans serif} (used in presentations slides) and
\texttt{monospace} (used when displaying code). In order to adjust the fonts used for
a particular language, define \cargv{\textit{language}fontsf} family for sans serif and
\cargv{\textit{language}fonttt} for monospace. For example, to define CMU as a
font for Greek in all three fonts when using \hologo{LuaLaTeX} you would write
\begin{minted}{latex}
  \newfontfamily\greekfont{CMU Serif}
  \newfontfamily\greekfontsf{CMU Sans Serif}
  \newfontfamily\greekfonttt{CMU Typewriter Text}
\end{minted}
\pagebreak[3]
or in \hologo{XeLaTeX}
\begin{minted}{latex}
  \newfontfamily\greekfont[
    Extension=.otf, UprightFont=*rm, ItalicFont=*ti,
    BoldFont=*bx, BoldItalicFont=*bi,
  ]{cmun}
  \newfontfamily\greekfontsf[
    Extension=.otf, UprightFont=*ss, ItalicFont=*si,
    BoldFont=*sx, BoldItalicFont=*so, 
  ]{cmun}
  \newfontfamily\greekfonttt[
    Extension=.otf, UprightFont=*btl, ItalicFont=*bto,
    BoldFont=*tb, BoldItalicFont=*tx, 
  ]{cmun}
\end{minted}

The commands above redefine the fonts for languages used as \enquote*{other} in
polyglossia. If you want to influence the font of the main document language
use the \csi{setmainfont}, \csi{setsansfont} and \csi{setmonofont} that work the
same way but without the \carg{familyname} argument.
\begin{minted}{latex}
  \setmainfont{CMU Serif}
  \setsansfont{CMU Sans Serif}
  \setmonofont{CMU Typewriter Text}
\end{minted}

If you want to learn even more about fonts, have a look at
\autoref{sec:fontspec}.

\subsubsection{Right to Left (RTL) languages}

Some languages are written left to right, others are written right to left
(RTL). \pai{polyglossia} needs the \pai*{bidi} package\footnote{\pai{bidi}
  supports only the \hologo{XeTeX} engine. If you use \hologo{LuaTeX}
  \pai{polyglossia} uses the \pai*{luabidi} package, but keep in mind that it is
  much more limited than \pai{bidi}.} in order to support RTL languages. The
\pai{bidi} package should be the last package you load, even after
\pai{hyperref} which is usually the last package. (Since \pai{polyglossia}
loads \pai{bidi} this means that \pai{polyglossia} should be the last package
loaded.)

\begin{example}[standalone, template=empty, paperwidth=0.35\linewidth, paperheight=4cm]
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setdefaultlanguage{arabic}
%!hidebegin
\usepackage[paperheight=\height,paperwidth=\width,margin=1cm,includefoot]{geometry}
\defaultfontfeatures[Iran Nastaliq] {
  Path=src/font-IranNastaliq/WebFonts/,
  Extension=.ttf,
  UprightFont=IranNastaliq-Web,
  Script=Arabic,
}
%!hideend
\newfontfamily\arabicfont{Iran Nastaliq}

\begin{document}
%!showbegin !hide
«\textarabic{هذا نص عربي}»
%!showend !hide
هذا نص عربي % !hide
\end{document}
\end{example}

The package \pai*{xepersian}\footnote{Works only with
  \hologo{XeLaTeX}.}\index{Persian} offers support for the Persian language. It
supplies Persian \LaTeX-commands that allows you to enter commands like
\csi{section} in Persian, which makes this really attractive to native speakers.
\pai{xepersian} is the only package that supports kashida\index{kashida} with
\hologo{XeLaTeX}. A package for Syriac which uses a similar algorithm is under
development.

To typeset Arabic you may use the Iran Nastaliq font~\cite{font:IranNastaliq}
developed by the SCICT and updated by Mohammad Saleh Souzanchi.

The \pai*{arabxetex} package supports several languages with
an Arabic script:
\begin{itemize}
  \item arab (Arabic)\index{Arabic}
  \item persian\index{Persian}
  \item urdu\index{Urdu}
  \item sindhi\index{Sindhi}
  \item pashto\index{Pashto}
  \item ottoman (turk)\index{Ottoman}\index{Turkish}
  \item kurdish\index{Kurdish}
  \item kashmiri\index{Kashmiri}
  \item malay (jawi)\index{Malay}\index{Jawi}
  \item uighur\index{Uighur}
\end{itemize}

It offers a font mapping that enables \hologo{XeLaTeX} to process input
using the Arab\TeX{} ASCII transcription.

There is no package available for Hebrew\index{Hebrew} because none is needed.
The Hebrew support in \pai{polyglossia} should be sufficient. But you do need a
suitable font with real Unicode Hebrew. SBL Hebrew~\cite{font:sblhebrew} is a
non-free font available for non-commercial use. Another font, available under
the SIL Open Font License, is Ezra SIL~\cite{font:ezrasil}.

\subsubsection{Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK)}%
\index{Chinese}\index{Japanese}\index{Korean}

The package \pai*{xeCJK}\footnote{Works only with
  \hologo{XeLaTeX}.} takes care of font selection and
punctuation for these languages.

\section{The Space Between Words}

To get a straight right margin in the output, \LaTeX{} inserts varying
amounts of space between the words. It inserts slightly more space at
the end of a sentence, as this makes the text more readable.  \LaTeX{}
assumes that sentences end with periods, question marks or exclamation
marks. If a period follows an uppercase letter, this is not taken as a
sentence ending, since periods after uppercase letters normally occur in
abbreviations.

Any exception from these assumptions has to be specified by the author. A
backslash in front of a space generates a space that will not be enlarged. A
tilde~\enquote*{\ai{\~}} character generates a non-breaking space (prohibits a
line break). The command \csi{@} in front of a period specifies that this
period terminates a sentence even when it follows an uppercase letter.
\csih{@}\ai{\~}\index{tilde@tilde (\verb.~.)}% chktex 18
\index{., space after}

\begin{example}
Mr.~Smith was happy to see her\\
cf.~Fig.~5\\
I like BASIC\@. What about you?
\end{example}

The additional space after periods can be disabled with the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{frenchspacing}
\end{lscommand}
which tells \LaTeX{} \emph{not} to insert more space after a period than after
an ordinary character. This is very common in non-English languages
(\pai{polyglossia} sets it automatically based on the main language).

\section{Titles, Chapters, and Sections}

To help the reader find his or her way through your work, you should
divide it into chapters, sections, and subsections.  \LaTeX{} supports
this with special commands that take the section title as their
argument.  It is up to you to use them in the correct order.

The following sectioning commands are available for the
\texttt{article} class: \nopagebreak

\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{section}[title: m]\\
  \csi{subsection}[title: m]\\
  \csi{subsubsection}[title: m]\\
  \csi{paragraph}[title: m]\\
  \csi{subparagraph}[title: m]
\end{lscommand}

If you want to split your document into parts without influencing the
section or chapter numbering use
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{part}[title: m]
\end{lscommand}

When you work with the \texttt{report} or \texttt{book} class,
an additional top-level sectioning command becomes available
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{chapter}[title: m]
\end{lscommand}

As the \texttt{article} class does not know about chapters, it is quite easy
to add articles as chapters to a book.
The spacing between sections, the numbering and the font size of the
titles will be set automatically by \LaTeX.

\LaTeX{} creates a table of contents by taking the section headings
and page numbers from the last compile cycle of the document. The command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{tableofcontents}
\end{lscommand}
\noindent expands to a table of contents at the place it is issued. A new
document has to be compiled twice to get a correct \wi{table of contents}.
Sometimes it might be necessary to compile the document a third time. \LaTeX{}
will tell you when this is necessary.

All sectioning commands listed above also exist as starred versions. This
generates section headings that do not show up in the table of contents and are
not numbered. The command \mintinline{latex}|\section{Help}|, for example,
would become \mintinline{latex}|\section*{Help}|.

Normally the section headings show up in the table of contents exactly
as they are entered in the text. Sometimes this is not possible,
because the heading is too long to fit into the table of contents. The
entry for the table of contents can then be specified as an
optional argument in front of the actual heading.

\begin{example}[standalone, paperwidth=6cm,paperheight=5cm]
\begin{document}%!hide
\tableofcontents

\section[Title for the
  table of contents]{A long 
  and especially boring title,
  shown in the text}
\end{document}%!hide
\end{example}

The \wi{title} of the whole document is generated by issuing a
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{maketitle}
\end{lscommand}
command. The contents of the title have to be defined by the commands
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{title}[title: m], \csi{author}[author: m]
  and optionally \csi{date}[date: m]
\end{lscommand}
before calling \mintinline{latex}|\maketitle|. In the argument to \csi{author}, you can supply several names separated by \csi{and} commands.

An example of some of the commands mentioned above can be found in
\autoref{document} on \autopageref{document}.

Apart from the sectioning commands explained above, \LaTeX{} defines four
additional commands for use with the \texttt{book} class. They are useful for
dividing your publication. The commands alter chapter headings and page
numbering to work as you would expect in a book:
\begin{description}
  \item[\csi{frontmatter}] should be the very first command after the start of
    the document body
    \begin{chktexignore}
  (\mintinline{latex}|\begin{document}|).
\end{chktexignore}
    It will switch page
    numbering to Roman numerals and sections will be non-enumerated as if you were
    using the starred sectioning commands (for example
    \mintinline{latex}|\chapter*{Preface}|) but the sections will still show up in
    the table of contents.
  \item[\csi{mainmatter}] comes right before the first chapter of
    the book. It turns on Arabic page numbering and restarts the page
    counter.
  \item[\csi{appendix}] marks the start of additional material in your book.
    After this command chapters will be numbered with letters. Unlike others
    this method can also be used inside articles. In this case it changes the
    numbering of sections.
  \item[\csi{backmatter}] should be inserted before the very last items
    in your book, such as the bibliography and the index. In the standard
    document classes, this has no visual effect.
\end{description}

\section{Cross References}\label{sec:crossref}

In books, reports and articles, there are often
\wi{cross-references} to figures, tables and special segments of text.
\LaTeX{} provides the following commands for cross referencing
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{label}[marker: m], \csi{ref}[marker: m]
  and \csi{pageref}[marker: m]
\end{lscommand}
where \carg{marker} is an identifier chosen by the user. \LaTeX{} replaces
\csi{ref} by the number of the section, subsection, figure, table, or theorem
after which the corresponding \csi{label} command was issued. \csi{pageref}
prints the page number of the page where the \csi{label} command
occurred.\footnote{Note that these commands are not aware of what they refer
  to. \csi{label} just saves the last automatically generated number.} As with
section titles and page numbers for the table of contents, the numbers from the
previous compile cycle are used.

\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.4\textwidth]
A reference to this subsection%
\label{sec:this} looks like:
\enquote{see Section~\ref{sec:this}
on page~\pageref{sec:this}.}
\end{example}

\section{Footnotes}
With the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{footnote}[footnote text: m]
\end{lscommand}
a footnote is printed at the foot of the current page.  Footnotes should always
be put after the word or sentence they refer to. Footnotes referring to a
sentence or part of it should therefore be put after the comma or period.

\begin{example}
Footnotes\footnote{This is
  a footnote.} are often used
by people using \LaTeX.
\end{example}

\section{Lists}

The \ei{itemize} environment is suitable for simple lists, the
\ei{enumerate} environment for enumerated lists, and the
\ei{description} environment for descriptions.
\csih{item}

\begin{example}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You can nest the list
environments to your taste:
\begin{itemize}
\item But it might start to
look silly.
\item[-] With a dash.
\end{itemize}
\item Therefore remember:
\begin{description}
\item[Stupid] things will not
become smart because they are
in a list.
\item[Smart] things, though,
can be presented beautifully
in a list.
\end{description}
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\section{Non-Justified Text}\label{sec:ragged}

By default \LaTeX{} justifies text inside a document. While this is desirable
for the main text there may be occasions where you want the text to be left- or
\wi{right-aligned}\index{left-aligned}. This is where the \pai*{ragged2e}
package is useful. It defines environments
\begin{lscommand}
  \ei{FlushLeft} \\
  \ei{FlushRight} \\
  \ei{Center}
\end{lscommand}
which allow you to achieve left-aligned, right-aligned and centred text.

\begin{example}
\begin{FlushLeft}
  This text is\\ left-aligned.
  \LaTeX{} is not trying to make
  each line the same length.
\end{FlushLeft}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\begin{FlushRight}
  This text is right-\\aligned.
  \LaTeX{} is not trying to make
  each line the same length.
\end{FlushRight}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\begin{Center}
  At the centre\\of the earth
\end{Center}
\end{example}

\section{Quotations}\label{sec:csquotes}

You should \emph{not} use the \enquote*{\texttt{"}} for %chktex 18
\wi{quotation marks}\index{""@\texttt{""}} for quotation as you would when
using a WYSIWYG program.  In publishing there are special opening and closing
quotation marks. In \LaTeX{}, the \pai*{csquotes} package provides the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{enquote}[text: m]
\end{lscommand}
command that will automatically enclose the \carg{text} within the right
quotes.
\begin{example}
\enquote{Please press
  the \enquote{x} key.}
\end{example}

If you want to skip directly to inner form of quotation use starred version of
the command
\begin{example}
The \enquote*{x} key is here.
\end{example}

\subsection{Formal Quotes}

The above commands are useful when you want to use for example scare quotes. If
you are actually quoting someone else it is better to use the \csi{textquote}
command. It accepts an optional argument with the source of the quote.
\begin{example}
\textquote[A.~Einstein]{Why
  is it nobody understands
  me and everybody likes me?}
\end{example}

For longer quotations you may want to use the \ei{displayquote} environment.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.5\linewidth]
As Einstein once said
\begin{displayquote}[%
  Albert Einstein]
  Whoever undertakes to
  set himself up as a judge
  of Truth and Knowledge is
  shipwrecked by the laughter
  of the gods.
\end{displayquote}
\end{example}

In academic writing there may be strict rules present when quotes should be
typeset inline and when they should be typeset in display style based on their
length. This can be achieved automatically using the \csi{blockquote} command.
It will scan the text inside and typeset the quote accordingly.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.5\textwidth]
\csdisplaytrue%!hide
\blockquote[Me]{A short quote}

\blockquote[Also Me]{A very long
  quote that spans over multiple
  lines and should be typeset in
  display quote style
  according to my publisher.}
\end{example}
By default the \csi{blockquote} will switch to display quote style if the quote
spans more than three lines or contains more than one paragraph. The number of
lines may be changes using the \cargv{threshold} package options. If you prefer
to count words instead of lines you may change the \cargv{thresholdtype} from
lines to words and set \cargv{threshold} accordingly. If you want to ignore
paragraphs and rely only on automatic lines\slash{}words counting, set the
\cargv{parthreshold} to false.

The quote attribution shown in the previous examples is especially useful when
combined with bibliography commands described later in
\autoref{chap:bibliography}.

\subsection{Foreign Quotes}

The \pai{csquotes} has excellent integration with \pai{polyglossia}, thus
simply changing the main language document automatically adapts the quotation
marks used.
\begin{example}
%!showbegin !hide
% In preamble
\setmainlanguage{french}
% ...
%!showend !hide
\setquotestyle{french} %!hide

\textquote[Antoine de
  Saint Exupéry]{Toute
  nation est égoïste.
  Toute nation considère
  son égoïsme comme sacré.}
\end{example}

If you load the package with \cargv{autostyle} option it will also adapt the
quotation marks used based on the language of the surrounding text.
\begin{example}
%!showbegin !hide
% In preamble
\usepackage[autostyle]{csquotes}
% ...
%!showend !hide

\enquote{English quote}

\begin{german}
  \enquote{Deutsches zitat}
\end{german}
\end{example}

If you are often quoting in foreign language you may get tired of first
switching to a given language using a polyglossia command and then using
\csi{textquote}. In order to avoid it, \pai{csquotes} defines additional
\csi{foreignquote} command that take the language as its first language.
\begingroup
\setmonofont{cmuntt.otf}
\begin{example}
As Dostoevsky once wrote
\foreignquote{russian}{%
  Мир спасёт красота}.
\end{example}
\endgroup
The commands \csi{foreigntextquote}, \csi{foreignblockquote} and environment
\ei{foreigndisplayquote} are also available and work analogously to the ones
described in previous section.

Some languages have multiple variants of quotes used. To change the variant
used by the given language add option \cargv{\carg{language}=\carg{variant}}
when loading the \pai{csquotes} package.
\begin{example}
%!showbegin !hide
% In preamble
\usepackage[
  autostyle,
  german=guillemets,
]{csquotes}
% ...
%!showend !hide

\setquotestyle[guillemets]{german} %!hide
\foreignquote{german}{%
  Deutsches zitat}
\end{example}

\subsection{Long Quotations and Poetry}
\LaTeX{} provides two additional environments: the \ei{quotation} and the
\ei{verse} environments. The \texttt{quotation} environment is useful for
longer quotes going over several paragraphs, because it indents the first line
of each paragraph. The \texttt{verse} environment is useful for poems where the
line breaks are important. The lines are separated by issuing a \csi{\bs} at the
end of a line and an empty line after each verse. Note that this environments
are not defined by \pai{csquotes} so they do not accept optional argument with
attribution and are not context sensitive.

\begin{example}
I wanted to quote my
favourite speech:
\begin{quotation}
  This is a very
  long speech.

  It spans over multiple
  paragraphs.
\end{quotation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
I know only one English
poem by heart. It is
about Humpty Dumpty.
\begin{verse}
  Humpty Dumpty sat
  on a wall:\\
  Humpty Dumpty had
  a great fall.\\
  All the King's horses
  and all the King's men\\
  Couldn't put Humpty
  together again.
\end{verse}
\end{example}

\section{Code Listings}\label{sec:code_listings}

When writing about \LaTeX{} or other programming languages, you often need to
insert short code snippets like this \verb|\LaTeX{}|. While you could escape
all the characters, this would quickly become rather tiresome, especially for
longer pieces of code where correct spacing (collapsed by \LaTeX{} to single
spaces) is crucial for readability. We will present three solutions to this
problem.

\subsection{Verbatim}\label{sec:verbatim}

\LaTeX{} itself comes with the \csi{verb} command. It is unusual in that it does
not use groups for getting its first argument. Instead you pass the argument between a
chosen delimiters that can be any character except a letter, \verb|*| or
space. For example to use \cargv{|} (which is typically used) as a delimiter
you type
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{verb}[|«\bs carg{text}»|: c]
\end{lscommand}
Text that is enclosed between these delimiters will be directly printed, as if
typed on a typewriter, with all spaces, without any \LaTeX{} command being
executed.
\begin{example}
Use \verb|\LaTeX{}| to 
print \LaTeX.

We normally use \verb+|+ but
when it's not available we
use \verb|+| to delimit the
argument of the \verb|\verb|
command.
\end{example}

The starred version of the \csi{verb} command replaces spaces with the
\enquote*{\textvisiblespace{}} symbol.

\begin{chktexignore}
\begin{example}
\verb*|\TeX user| will
produce \TeX user.

To get proper spacing use
\verb*|\TeX{} user|.

Several spaces are treated
by \LaTeX{} as one space, 
so \verb*|a     b| will
produce a     b.
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

For longer text you may want to use the \ei{verbatim} environment from the
\pai*{verbatim} package.
\begin{example}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
Small is beautiful.
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}
Its starred version will analogously draw the \enquote*{\textvisiblespace}
symbol instead of spaces.

For code snippets it may be useful to store them in their dedicated files,
outside the \LaTeX{} document. This allows to edit them in your editor of
choice and makes the document code less cluttered. To accomplish this use the
\csi{verbatiminput}[file: m] command from the \pai{verbatim} package.\footnote{This
  and following examples uses code snippets that can be found at \url{https://github.com/oetiker/lshort/tree/master/src/examples}.}
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.55\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\verbatiminput{hello.c}
\end{example}
\csi{verbatiminput*} also exists and works exactly as you would predict.

The \texttt{verbatim} environment and the \csi{verb}, \csi{verbatiminput}
commands may not be used within parameters of other commands, so the below code
will result in an error
\begin{minted}{latex}
Text\footnote{\verb|abc| cannot be used here.}
\end{minted}
If this is a problem for you look at the \pai*{fancyvrb} package.

\subsection{The \ei{listings} Package}

While the \ei{verbatim} environment is fine for small snippets, they are very
crude and look basic. In order to make them a bit more fancy you may use the
\pai*{listings} package. It defines
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{lstinline} command that works like \csi{verb} \\
  \ei{lstlisting} environment that works like \ei{verbatim} \\
  \csi{lstinputlisting} command that works like \csi{verbatiminput}
\end{lscommand}
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\lstinline|\LaTeX{}|

\begin{lstlisting}
Here is some \LaTeX{} code.
\end{lstlisting}

\lstinputlisting{hello.c}
\end{example}

As you can see by default it isn't much different from the \ei{verbatim
  environment}. The big difference is that every command accepts optional
argument that allows to customise the output. The argument accepts comma
delimited key value list. For example to automatically highlight the code we
may pass the \cargv{language} key.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{hello.c}
\end{example}
If a language has several dialects you may specify it inside square brackets
before the language name. You must enclose this value in the curly brackets.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\lstinputlisting[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]{hello.tex}
\end{example}
When presenting code it is often that we want to point to a specific line. To
save the reader from counting which line we mean, it is possible to print line
numbers using \cargv{numbers} key. Its possible values are \cargv{none},
\cargv{left} and \cargv{right}.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\lstset{xleftmargin=1.2em}%!hide
\lstinputlisting[language=C, numbers=left]{hello.c}
\end{example}
The appearance of numbers may be further customised with the following keys:
\begin{description}
  \item[\cargv{firstnumber}] allows you to specify the first number. Besides
    numbers this key can also contain two special values: \cargv{last} and
    \cargv{auto} (the default). \cargv{last} continues numbering from the last
    listing, while \cargv{auto} continues it from the last listing with the
    same \cargv{name} argument or starts over if no \cargv{name} is present.
  \item[\cargv{stepnumber}] allows to print only every \(n\)-th number. For
    example if you pass \cargv{stepnumber=7}, then only line numbers \(1, 8,
    15, 22, \ldots\) will be printed.
  \item[\cargv{numberblanklines}] controls whether line numbers are printed on
    empty lines. Either \cargv{true} or \cargv{false}.
  \item[\cargv{numberstyle}] allows to customise the font for printing
    numbers. It accepts switch commands described in \autoref{sec:fontsize}.
\end{description}
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.61\linewidth]
\lstinputlisting[
  language=C,
  numbers=left,
  stepnumber=2,
  numberblanklines=false,
  firstnumber=4,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  numberstyle=\tiny,
]{hello.c}
\end{example}

If you have a long file and want to show it piecewise you can use the
\cargv{firstline} and \cargv{lastline} keys.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth]
The \lstinline|main|
function body
consists of:
\lstinputlisting[
  language=C,
  firstline=5,
  lastline=6,
]{hello.c}
\end{example}

If you are trying to typeset long lines you may order the \pai{listings} to
automatically break them using the key \cargv{breaklines}.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth]
\lstinputlisting[
  language=python,
  numbers=left,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  breaklines,
]{factorial.py}
\end{example}
You may customise the indentation width with the \cargv{breakindent} key. It
may be useful to indicate that a linebreak occurred using \cargv{prebreak}
and/or \cargv{postbreak} keys that include their contents before and after an
artificial linebreak. \autoref{lst:prepostbreak} shows an example of doing it.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\lstinputlisting[
  language=python,
  numbers=left,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  breaklines,
  breakindent=1cm,
  prebreak=\textrightarrow,
  postbreak=\textleftarrow,
]{factorial.py}
\end{example}
  \caption{An example of marking the artificial linebreaks in \ei{listing}
    package.}\label{lst:prepostbreak}
\end{listing}

One of the neat features of the \pai{listings} package is that you can evaluate
\LaTeX{} code inside the code itself. The easiest way is to pass the
\cargv{texcl} key. It enables \LaTeX{} syntax inside the comments.
\begin{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  texcl,
  language=haskell,
]
-- I can use \LaTeX{} here.
-- The cost is in \texteuro{}
cost x = show (
    foldr (+) 0 x
  ) ++ " eur"
\end{lstlisting}
\end{example}

This feature is especially useful with \csi{label} command. We can use it to
point to a specific line of code without hardcoding it into the document.
\begin{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  texcl,
  numbers=left,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  language=haskell,
]
cost x = show (
    foldr (+) 0 x 
  ) ++ " eur" -- \label{concat}
\end{lstlisting}
The \lstinline|++| in Haskell
as seen in line~\ref{concat}
means string concatenation.
\end{example}
This has the downside that it introduces empty comments that are just there to
include label. To fix this we may use the \cargv{escapeinside} key that accepts
sets the two delimiters between which \LaTeX{} code can be typed. The
delimiters themselves will not be printed.
\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[
  escapeinside={(*}{*)},
  numbers=left,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  language=haskell,
]
cost x = show ( (*\label{show}*)
    foldr (+) 0 x 
  ) ++ " eur" (*(\texteuro)*)
\end{lstlisting}
The \lstinline|show| in Haskell
as seen in line~\ref{show}
converts its argument to a string.
\end{example}

If you do not like the default style of listings, you may customise them using
the
\begin{lscommand}
  \cargv{basicstyle}, \cargv{keywordstyle}, \cargv{identifierstyle} and
  \cargv{commentstyle}
\end{lscommand}
keys. Note that you will need some font changing commands which
you will learn about in \autoref{sec:fontsize}.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.55\linewidth]
\lstinputlisting[
  language=SQL,
  basicstyle=\ttfamily,
  commentstyle=\color{gray},
  keywordstyle=\itshape,
]{employee.sql}
\end{example}

If you intend to use similar options for many listings in the document you may
use the \csi{lstset} command to set them beforehand. This way you will avoid
repeating them with every time you want to typeset some code.

\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.55\linewidth]
\lstset{
  language=C,
  numbers=left,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  breaklines,
  basicstyle=\ttfamily,
  prebreak=\textrightarrow,
}

\lstinputlisting{hello.c}

The statement
\lstinline|int x = 1;|
assigns 1 to variable
\lstinline|x|.
\end{example}

\subsection{The \pai{minted} Package}

While the \pai{listings} package allows to typeset pretty decent looking code
snippets, you may find it still lacking in some respects. The most obvious
problem is the syntax highlighting: you may find that your language of choice
is not supported. You can write a custom style for the language but it relies
on a simple keyword search, so this is an option only for simple languages.

If this is a problem for you it may be worth to consider the \pai*{minted}
package. It relies on the Pygments~\cite{pygments} program to highlight code.
In contrast to the \pai{listings} package, this program uses pushdown automata
to colour the code which may produce much better results. Moreover the
predefined styles and language support are much richer than those offered by
the \pai{listings} package. This is the package that is used to colour examples
throughout this booklet.

Due to the fact that the \pai{minted} package relies on an external program
there are two things that you need to do before using it
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ensure that the Pygments program is installed. If you are using a
        \Unix{} system it is probably enough to execute\\
        \verb|pip install Pygments|\\
        You can find more information at their official website:
        \citeurl{pygments} and in the \pai*{minted} package documentation.

  \item
        Add \verb|--shell-escape| flag when compiling \LaTeX{} document, for
        example:\\
        \verb|xelatex --shell-escape document.tex|
\end{enumerate}
It is important to understand what the cryptic flag mentioned in the second
point actually means. It allows the \LaTeX{} document to call any external program via
the shell. Let me repeat this to make the point clear: \emph{Enabling this flag
  allows the \LaTeX{} document to call any program via the shell}. This means that
maliciously crafted document could for example delete all files from your
computer. Only enable this flag if the document comes from a trusted source.

Once you meet this requirements you can use the package in a manner similar to
the previous approaches. It provides
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{mintinline}[options:o, language:m, code:m] \\
  \csi{inputminted}[options:o, language:m, code:m] \\
  \ei*{minted}[options:o, language:m]
\end{lscommand}
In contrast to the \pai{listings} the \carg{language} is a required parameter.
The command \csi{mintinline} works with both normal groups and custom
delimiters.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.56\linewidth]
\mintinline{latex}|\LaTeX{}|

\begin{minted}{python}
x = 0
for i in range(10):
  x += 2**i
print(f"Result: {x}")
\end{minted}

\inputminted{rust}{age.rs}
\end{example}

Its capabilities are comparable to that of the \pai{listings} package. Some of
the options have synonyms that makes their usage identical to the
\pai{listings} package. For example to enable line numbers you may use the
\cargv{linenos} key (which is a boolean value) or the \cargv{numbers} key
(which accepts \cargv{left}, \cargv{right}, \cargv{none} or \cargv{both}).
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.56\linewidth]
\inputminted[
  linenos,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
]{css}{review.css}
\end{example}
You can change the line numbering using \cargv{firstnumber} and
\cargv{stepnumber}. Additionally you may highlight some lines using the
\cargv{highlightlines} key to draw attention to them. Note that
\cargv{highlightlines} uses the transformed line numbers.
\begin{chktexignore}
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.56\linewidth]
\inputminted[
  linenos,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  firstnumber=5,
  stepnumber=3,
  highlightlines={6, 10-12}
]{coq}{em.v}
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

Similarly to the \pai{listings} package, \cargv{breaklines} enables automatic
breaking of long lines, however it will only break the lines at whitespace
characters. If you want the breaks to occur anywhere use the
\cargv{breakanywhere} key. The breaking behaviour may be even more
fine-tuned using the keys \cargv{breakbytoken}, \cargv{breakbytokenanywhere},
\cargv{breakbefore} and \cargv{breakafter}.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.55\linewidth]
\inputminted[
  linenos,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  breaklines,
]{haskell}{quicksort.hs}
\end{example}
As you can see by default it inserts \enquote{\(\hookrightarrow\)} to indicate
that automatic linebreak occurred. You can customise the printed symbols using
the \cargv{breaksymbolleft} and \cargv{breaksymbolright} keys.

In order to use \LaTeX{} inside the comments you can use either the
\cargv{texcl} or its synonym \cargv{texcomments}. You can also add custom
\LaTeX{} escape delimiters using \cargv{escapeinside}, but unlike in
\pai{listings}, these must be single tokens.
\begin{example}
\begin{minted}[
  linenos,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  texcomments,
  escapeinside=||,
]{html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> |\label{head}|
    <title>On |\LaTeX{}|</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="review">
      <!-- \LaTeX{} review -->
      <p>It's awesome!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
\end{minted}
The \mintinline{html}{<head>} 
element in line~\ref{head}
contains page metadata.
\end{example}

The Pygments program comes with a lot of predefined styles for typesetting your
code. In order to choose between them use the \cargv{style} key.
\begin{example}
\inputminted[
  style=bw,
]{bash}{echo.sh}
\inputminted[
  style=sas,
]{bash}{echo.sh}
\inputminted[
  style=xcode,
]{bash}{echo.sh}
\end{example}

To avoid setting the options with every listing with every code snippet you
include, you can use \csi{setminted} to define the default values.
\begin{example}
\setminted{
  linenos,
  xleftmargin=1.2em, %!hide
  breaklines,
  style=xcode,
}
\inputminted{c++}{goodbye.cpp}
\end{example}

\section{Tables}\label{sec:tables}

In \LaTeX{} the environment to typeset tables (and more) is called
\ei{tabular}. While it can be used on its own, the resulting table layouts look
extremely old fashioned. We recommend to add the \pai*{booktabs} package which
provides several commands that let you typeset beautiful modern looking tables.
To achieve some more advanced table layouts you will also learn about the
\pai*{longtable}, \pai*{array} and \pai*{multirow} packages in this section.
They are so useful, that you probably want to put them all into the preamble of
your document right away.

In addition to the description description of the commands, the \pai{booktabs}
package documentation~\cite{pack:booktabs} contains guidelines on typesetting
professional-looking tables. We have taken these guidelines to heart when
writing this booklet. You will find some of them in this section.

\subsection{Basic Tables}

The environment \ei{tabular} has the following form
\begin{lscommand}
  \ei*{tabular}[pos:o, colspec:m]
\end{lscommand} %
The \carg{colspec} argument, which stands for columns specifiers, defines the
format of the columns in the table. Use an \cargv{l} for a column of left-aligned text,
\cargv{r} for right-aligned text, and \cargv{c} for centred text. Inside the
environment use \ai{\&} to go to next cell within the row and
\csi{\bs} to go to the next row.
\begin{example}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
  left & centre & right \\
  1    & 2      & 3     \\
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
Note that the text inside the cells will not be wrapped. If you want the column
to contain justified text with linebreaks use the \cargv{p\{\carg{width}\}}
column specifier, where \carg{width} is the width of the column.
\begin{example}
\begin{tabular}{lp{3cm}}
  left & Very long paragraph
         that gets broken into
         multiple lines. \\
  1    & Another one,
         but shorter. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{example}

The optional \carg{pos} argument specifies the vertical position of the table
with respect to baseline of the text. There are three possible alignments:
\cargv{c} centres the table (the default), \cargv{t} matches the baseline of
the top row and \cargv{b} matches the baseline of the bottom row.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.85\linewidth, vertical_mode]
text
\begin{tabular}{ll} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ \end{tabular}
text
\begin{tabular}[t]{ll} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ \end{tabular}
text
\begin{tabular}[b]{ll} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ \end{tabular}
text
\end{example}

What we have shown so far allows aligning some items in rows and columns,
but real tables need visible headings. To insert them use the commands
\csi{toprule}, \csi{midrule} and \csi{bottomrule} from the \pai{booktabs} package.
All of these accept an optional argument that specifies their thickness, but
usually the default settings are just fine. See
\autoref{lst:booktabssimple} for an example of using these commands.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
  \toprule
  Alignment & Letter & Niceness  \\
  \midrule
  Left      & l      & Very nice \\
  Centre    & c      & Very nice \\
  Right     & r      & Very nice \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{A simple table using the \ei{booktabs} commands.}\label{lst:booktabssimple}
\end{listing}

With these commands you are already able to produce simple, yet nicely looking
tables. You may be are wondering why we have not mentioned how to add vertical
lines between the columns. Well, we did not mention them because the first rule
of producing professional-looking tables is that you \emph{must not} use
vertical lines.

The second rule is to never use double lines such as these shown in
\autoref{lst:doublerule}.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  \toprule[0.1cm]
  \toprule
  Person      & Face & Table    \\
  \midrule
  \midrule
  Me          & :(   & Not nice \\
  You         & :[   & Awful    \\
  Your reader & :<   & Terrible \\
  \bottomrule
  \bottomrule[0.1cm]
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}
  \caption{An anti-example of using double rules inside a table.}\label{lst:doublerule}
\end{listing}
The default lines are already of different weight in order to signify
their meaning. Using more lines than is necessary means cluttering the space
without adding information. If you stick to these two rules your tables will
look quite good already.

To make the tables look even more sleek you may want to remove the padding in
the first and last column. To control the space between the columns use the
\cargv{@\{\carg{sep}\}} column specifier, where \carg{sep} is either text or
space. Space of arbitrary length can be inserted using the \csi{hspace}[width:
  m] command. The contents of the \carg{sep} arguments will be put between cells
in the relevant column.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.3\linewidth]
\begin{tabular}{
  @{a} c @{\hspace{1cm}} c @{|} c @{ b}
}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\
  4 & 5 & 6\\
  7 & 8 & 9\\
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
If you leave the \carg{sep} empty it will suppress the padding between the
columns. See \autoref{lst:sleek} for an example.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
  \toprule

Sometimes it may make sense to group columns under one heading. To achieve this
we need two things: a way to group multiple heading columns and have a line
covering the same columns, to sit underneath the merged heading cell. Use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{multicolumn}[ncols:m, colspec:m, text:m]
\end{lscommand}
command to merge the cells. The \carg{ncols} argument indicates how many
columns should the \carg{text} span, while the \carg{colspec} is the column
specification for the new content---the same as when starting a \ei{tabular}
environment. See \autoref{lst:multicolumn} for an example.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.8\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
  \toprule
  Person      & Face & Table                      \\
  \midrule
  Me          & :)   & Nice                       \\
  You         & :]   & Sleek                      \\
  Your reader & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Not available} \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}
  \caption{An example of using the \csi{multicolumn} command in a table.}\label{lst:multicolumn}
\end{listing}

To get a horizontal line to span multiple columns, use the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{cmidrule}[dim:o, trim:p, a-b:m]
\end{lscommand}
While the command uses nonstandard syntax for \carg{trim}, this is just an
optional argument with different pair of delimiters.\footnote{This syntax
  allows to specify the second optional argument without specifying the first,
  which would be impossible if square brackets were used for both.} The
\carg{dim} allows us to specify the thickness of the line. The \carg{trim}
argument accepts any combination of \cargv{r}, \cargv{r\{\carg{dim}\}},
\cargv{l} or \cargv{l\{\carg{dim}\}}. This allows you trim the rule from right
or left, either by the package default or the specified \carg{dim}. It is
usually recommended to trim the rules from the side where they touch other
columns. Finally the only required argument \carg{a-b} is the span of columns
to draw the line over. See \autoref{lst:cmidrule} for an example.
\begin{listing}

  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.85\linewidth, vertical_mode]

\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}
  \caption{An example of using the \csi{cmidrule} command inside a table.}\label{lst:cmidrule}
\end{listing}

If you need a cell to span multiple rows instead of columns, then you have to
use package \pai{multirow}. Its main command is a little more complicated
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{multirow}[vpos:o, nrows:m, width:m, vmove:o, text:m]
\end{lscommand}
The arguments are
\begin{description}
  \item[\carg{vpos}] is the vertical position of the text within the cell.
    Can be either \cargv{c} for centre (the default), \cargv{t} for top or
    \cargv{b} for bottom.
  \item[\carg{nrows}] is the number of rows for the new cell to span.
  \item[\carg{width}] is the width of the cell. Apart from a regular length,
    you can also pass two special arguments here: \cargv{*} for the natural
    length of the text and \cargv{=} for the same width as the column (this
    only makes sense if the column width was specified, for example via
    \cargv{p\{3cm\}}).
  \item[\carg{vmove}] allows adjusting the position of the text if it sits too
    low or too high.
  \item[\carg{text}] is the text to be put in the cell.
\end{description}
Unlike with \csi{multicolumn} you still have to write all the cells in remaining
rows, but they should be empty. See \autoref{lst:multirow} for an example.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.85\linewidth, vertical_mode]

  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}
  \caption{An example of using \csi{multirow} inside a table.}\label{lst:multirow}
\end{listing}

In general it is not a good idea to use the \csi{multirow} command for showing
values common to multiple rows. Usually repeating the values in question makes
the table more readable.

When typesetting numerical data in the table, you may want to align it by
decimal point. A way to do this (and more) is described in
\autoref{sec:sitables}. The section also contains some guidelines about
typesetting numerical data in tables.

\subsection{Long Tables}

Material typeset with the tabular environment always stays together on one
page. This poses a problem for especially long tables. If your table is not
very wide you may get away with it by typesetting its rows side by side. You
should then put a bigger space between those to indicate that these are
separate either by using \cargv{@\{...\}} or by putting an empty column between
those as shown in \autoref{lst:rowsnext}.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{example}[vertical_mode, examplewidth=0.6\linewidth]
\begin{tabular}{@{}cllcl@{}}
  \toprule
  Digit & Word  && Digit & Word  \\
  \midrule
  0     & Zero  && 5     & Five  \\
  1     & One   && 6     & Six   \\
  2     & Two   && 7     & Seven \\
  3     & Three && 8     & Eight \\
  4     & Four  && 9     & Nine  \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
  \caption{An example of producing table with rows next to each other.}\label{lst:rowsnext}
\end{listing}

This approach will obviously not work for \emph{really} long tables. This is
where the \pai{longtable} package shines. It defines a \ei{longtable}
environment that works similarly to \ei{tabular} environment, but allows
pagebreaks inside.

\begin{lscommand}
  \ei*{longtable}[align:o, colspec:m]
\end{lscommand}
In contrast to \ei{tabular}, the \ei{longtable} always starts a new paragraph
and is centred by default. Thus the optional argument \carg{align} specifies
whether the table should be centred, on the left or on the right. Use
\cargv{c}, \cargv{l} and \cargv{r} to specify this. The \carg{colspec} argument
is the same as in the \ei{tabular} environment. See \autoref{lst:longtable}
for an example.

Note that the pagebreaks are always placed between rows. If you have some tall
row thanks to \cargv{p\{...\}} specification, it will not broken as seen in
\autoref{lst:longtablepars}.

\end{example}
  \end{lined}

  \caption{An anti-example of using \ei{longtable} assuming it will break

\end{listing}

The \ei{longtable} environment defines also some additional commands that end
table rows. One of them is \csi{textbackslash*} which, similarly to its
paragraph use, prohibits pagebreak after the row. Another useful commands are
\csi{endhead}, \csi{endfirsthead}, \csi{endfoot} and \csi{endlastfoot}. If you end
the row with them they will set the preceding rows as headers and footers of
the table. The \csi{endhead} and \csi{endfoot} put the headers and footers on
every page while \csi{endfirsthead} and \csi{endlastfoot} put them on the first
and last page. An example of using these commands is presented in
\autoref{lst:longtablerunning}.

\end{listing}

Note that while you can use \csi{multicolumn} and \csi{multirow} normally within
the \ei{longtable} environment, the table may get very complicated and \LaTeX{}
will then need several passes to properly calculate the column widths.

\subsection{Advanced Tables and Non-Tables}

In regular text you can specify the amount of space between two lines as an
optional argument to the \csi{\textbackslash} command. Can the same be done
within the table? It turns out that it can, but there is one caveat. If you use
it together with a \cargv{p\{...\}} column, the space specified will be different
depending on column order.
\begin{example}[standalone, paperheight=3cm, paperwidth=0.57\linewidth]
\begin{document} %!hide
\noindent %!hide
\begin{tabular}{lp{1cm}}
  1 & 2\newline x \\[1cm]
  3 & 4           \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}l}
  2\newline x & 1 \\[1cm]
  4           & 3 \\
\end{tabular} 
\end{document} %!hide
\end{example}
This counterintuitive behaviour is caused by the fact that the space to add is
calculated based on the last column. In order to prevent that simply add
\mintinline{latex}|\usepackage{array}| to your preamble. Since there are no
downsides to this, it is recommended to always use this package when starting a
new document to avoid breaking tables that rely on the original behaviour
later. The \pai{array} package also defines some additional column specifiers.

The \cargv{p\{...\}} specifier allows to insert text with linebreaks into the
table. The text always starts from the top though, so the \pai{array} package
defines two additional specifiers \cargv{m\{...\}} for vertically centred text
and \cargv{b\{...\}} for text put vertically at the bottom.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.57\linewidth]
\begin{tabular}{
  lp{1.4cm}m{1.4cm}b{1.4cm}
}
  Cell                 &
  Top matches cell.    &
  Centre matches cell. &
  Bottom matches cell. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{example}

When a column must be formatted a certain way it is inconvenient to put
the same commands in every cell. Moreover if you decide that something needs to
be changed about the formatting, then you would have to edit every cell
individually. To avoid that, the \pai{array} package defines
\cargv{>\{\carg{cmds}\}} and \cargv{<\{\carg{cmds}\}} column specifiers which
can be used to put some code before and after a column.
\begin{example}
\begin{tabular}{
  l
  >{\begin{em}}l<{\end{em}}
}
  text & emphasised text \\
  text & emphasised text \\
  text & emphasised text \\
\end{tabular}
\end{example}

% TODO: Find a useful environment that still does this.
\begin{comment}
Some environments change the meaning of the \csi{\textbackslash} command thus
making it unavailable to go to the next row. In such occasions you may use the
\csi{tabularnewline} command.
\begin{example}
\begin{tabular}{
  >{\begin{FlushLeft}}
    p{2cm}
  <{\end{FlushLeft}}
  >{\begin{FlushRight}}
    p{2cm}
  <{\end{FlushRight}}
}
  This cell will
    be flushed left. &
  This cell will
    be flushed right.
  \tabularnewline

  This \\ is newline &
  Here \\ too
  \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
\end{comment}

While using \cargv{>\{...\}} and \cargv{<\{...\}} comes handy if we only have
one such column, it quickly becomes inconvenient when many column of the same
type appear in any tables. In that case it may be desirable to use the command
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{newcolumntype}[newcolspec:m, definition:m]
\end{lscommand}
where \carg{newcolspec} is a single letter used for specification of columns
and the \carg{definition} is what should be inserted in the table when using
it.
\begin{example}
\newcolumntype{e}{
  >{\begin{em}\begin{FlushLeft}}
  p{2.5cm}
  <{\end{FlushLeft}\end{em}}
}
\begin{tabular}{ee}
  This cell will
    be flushed left
    and emphasised. &
  This cell will
    be flushed left
    and emphasised.
  \tabularnewline

  This cell will
    be flushed left
    and emphasised. &
  This cell will
    be flushed left
    and emphasised.
  \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}
\end{example}

In order to create a tic-tac-toe grid you need to put some vertical and
horizontal lines of the same width. In order to do so you may use the
\cargv{|}~(vertical bar) column specifier for vertical rules and \csi{hline} for
horizontal rules.
\begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
  O & X & O \\
  \hline
  X & X & O \\
  \hline
  X & O & X \\
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}
In case your grid gets more complicated you may need the \csi{cline}[a-b: m] %chktex 8
command which draws horizontal line that spans only over the specified rows.
\begin{chktexignore}
  \begin{example}[examplewidth=0.35\linewidth]
\begin{tabular}{|cccc|}
  \cline{4-4}
  a & a & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{a} & b \\
  \cline{2-3}
  a & \multicolumn{1}{|c}{b} & b & b \\
  \cline{2-2}
  a & a & \multicolumn{1}{|c}{b} & b \\
  \cline{1-2}
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
\end{chktexignore}

\section{Including Graphics and Images}\label{sec:images}

\LaTeX{} itself does not provide facilities to include images. In order to so
it is necessary to use the \pai*{graphicx} package. It provides the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{includegraphics}[options: o, file: m]
\end{lscommand}
command that can be used to include the \carg{file} in the
document.\footnote{In the examples below we are using images from the
  \pai*{mwe} package that should be installed with your \LaTeX{} distribution.}
\begin{example}
Here is an image:
%!showbegin !hide
\includegraphics{example-image}
%!showend !hide
\includegraphics[width=3cm]{example-image}%!hide
\end{example}
The file may be either PDF, PNG or JPEG\@. If you omit the extension then
\LaTeX{} will try the following in order: \eei{.pdf}, \eei{.png}, \eei{.jpg},
\eei{.mps}, \eei{.jpeg}, \eei{.jbig2}, \eei{.jb2}. Note that if your filename
contains dots (other than the extension dot) then its basename has to be put in
curly braces like so:
\begin{code}
  \mintinline{latex}|\includegraphics{{image.with.dots}.jpg}|
\end{code}

The \carg{optoins} parameter is a comma delimited list of keys and values. The
most basic keys are \cargv{width} and \cargv{height}. If only one is supplied
then \LaTeX{} will calculate the other one to keep the aspect ratio of the
original image.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.85\linewidth, vertical_mode]
\includegraphics[width=2cm]{example-image}
\includegraphics[height=1cm]{example-image}
\includegraphics[width=2cm, height=1cm]{example-image}
\end{example}

You may also pass the \cargv{keepaspectratio} key. This will change the meaning
of \cargv{width} and \cargv{height} keys to the \emph{maximum} possible width
and height.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth]
\includegraphics[
  width=2cm,
  height=2cm,
]{example-image}
\includegraphics[
  width=2cm,
  height=2cm,
  keepaspectratio,
]{example-image}
\end{example}

Instead of specifying width or height you may also pass the \cargv{scale}
argument to scale it by a specific amount. Passing negative values will
reflect the image.
\begin{example}[examplewidth=0.6\linewidth]
\includegraphics[
  scale=0.1,
]{example-image}
\includegraphics[
  scale=0.3,
]{example-image}
\includegraphics[
  scale=-0.15,
]{example-image}
%!hidebegin
\vspace{1.3cm}
\end{example}

If you want to rotate the picture you may pass the \cargv{angle} key. By
default the image is rotated around bottom left corner. You may change the
anchor point by specifying the \cargv{origin} key. Its value may contain one or
two of the following specifications: \cargv{l} for left, \cargv{r} for right,
\cargv{c} for centre, \cargv{t} for top, \cargv{b} for bottom and \cargv{B} for
baseline (useful with \TikZ{} pictures as described in
\autoref{chap:graphics}). So for example \cargv{lc} will rotate the image
about the centre of its left edge, while \cargv{c} will rotate it around its
centre.
\begin{example}
Text \includegraphics[
  scale=0.1, %!hide
  angle=45,
]{example-image}
Text \includegraphics[
  scale=0.1, %!hide
  angle=180,
]{example-image}  \\
Text \includegraphics[
  scale=0.1, %!hide
  angle=180,
  origin=c,
]{example-image}
Text \includegraphics[
  scale=0.1, %!hide
  angle=180,
  origin=lt,
]{example-image}
\end{example}

If you want to show only a part of the picture you may specify the
\cargv{clip} key and set the \cargv{viewport} key to required part of the
image. The \cargv{viewport} takes as its value four numbers: first two specify
the left bottom point of rectangle, and the latter two specify the top right
point of rectangle.
\begin{example}
\includegraphics[
  clip,
  viewport=3cm 3cm 8.5cm 5.5cm,
]{example-image}
\end{example}

If you are including a PDF file, the \csi{includegraphics} will only include its
first page. If you want to specify a different page pass it to the \cargv{page}
key.
\begin{example}
\includegraphics[
  width=1.5cm,
]{example-image-a4-numbered}
\includegraphics[
  width=1.5cm,
  page=2,
]{example-image-a4-numbered}
\includegraphics[
  width=1.5cm,
  page=11,
]{example-image-a4-numbered}
\end{example}

If you pass the \cargv{draft} option then instead of images their name will be
printed to save on file size and processing time. This key will be inherited
from the \csi{documentclass} options if specified there.
\begin{example}
\includegraphics[
  scale=0.3,
  draft,
]{example-image}
\end{example}

\section{Floating Bodies}
If you try writing a longer text with tables and images you will soon notice a
problem: they cannot be broken across multiple pages (except for the
\pai{longtable}). If you simply include them in normal text flow this will lead
to a lot of empty space if the image is large and the text preceding it would
be to close to the bottom of the page. In the \autoref{lst:floatrationale} the
first page is half empty.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{lined}{11cm}
    \begin{example}[standalone, paperheight=4cm, to_page=2, vertical_pages]

\end{document}%!hide
\end{example}
  \end{lined}
  \caption{An anti-example of half-empty page due to a large, non-floated
    image.}\label{lst:floatrationale}
\end{listing}

The solution to this problem is to `float' any figure or table that
does not fit on the current page to a later page, while filling the
current page with body text. \LaTeX{} offers two environments for
\wi{floating bodies}; one for tables and  one for figures.  To
take full advantage of these two environments it is important to
understand approximately how \LaTeX{} handles floats internally.
Otherwise floats may become a major source of frustration, because
\LaTeX{} never puts them where you want them to be.

Let's first have a look at the commands \LaTeX{} supplies
for floats:

Any material enclosed in a \ei{figure} or \ei{table} environment will
be treated as floating matter.
parameter
\begin{lscommand}
  \ei*{figure}[placement specifier:o] \\
  \ei*{table}[placement specifier:o]
\end{lscommand}
The optional \carg{placement specifier} parameter is used to tell \LaTeX{}
about the locations to which the float is allowed to be moved.  A
\carg{placement specifier} is constructed by building a string of
\emph{float-placing permissions}. See \autoref{tab:permiss} for a description
of available specifiers. Note that the order of specifiers does not matter.

\begin{table}

      \texttt{p} & on a special \emph{page} containing only floats. \\
      \texttt{!} & without considering most of the
      internal parameters\footnote{Such as the
        maximum number of floats allowed  on one page.},
      which could otherwise stop this
      float from being placed.                                      \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
\end{table}

For example, a table float could be started with the following line
\begin{code}
\mintinline{latex}|\begin{table}[!hbp]|
\end{code}
The \wi{placement specifier} \cargv{[!hbp]} allows \LaTeX{} to
place the table right here (\cargv{h}) or at the bottom (\cargv{b})
of some page
or on a special floats page (\cargv{p}), and all this even if it does not
look that good (\cargv{!}). If no placement specifier is given, the standard
classes assume \cargv{[tbp]}.

\LaTeX{} will place every float it encounters according to the placement
specifier supplied by the author. If a float cannot be placed on the current
page it is deferred either to the figures queue or the tables
queue.\footnote{These are FIFO---`first in first out'---queues!}  When a new
page is started, \LaTeX{} first checks if it is possible to fill a special
\enquote*{float page} with floats from the queues. If this is not possible, the
first float on each queue is treated as if it had just occurred in the text:
\LaTeX{} tries again to place it according to its respective placement
specifiers (except \cargv{h}, which is no longer possible).  Any new floats
occurring in the text get placed into the appropriate queues. \LaTeX{} strictly
maintains the original order of appearance for each type of float. That's why a
figure that cannot be placed pushes all further figures to the end of the
document. Therefore:
\begin{quote}
  If \LaTeX{} is not placing the floats as you expected,
  it is often only one float jamming one of the two float queues.
\end{quote}

While it is possible to give \LaTeX{}  single-location placement specifiers,
this causes problems.  If the float does not fit in the location specified it
becomes stuck, blocking subsequent floats. In particular, you should never,
ever use the [h] option---it is so bad that in more recent versions of \LaTeX,
it is automatically replaced by [ht].

Using floats, the \autoref{lst:floatrationale} could be made better by
rewriting it like in the \autoref{lst:floatexample}. As you can see there,
\LaTeX{} now typeset the remaining text and delayed inserting the image until
the next page.

    placement inside a document.}\label{lst:floatexample}
\end{listing}

Having explained the difficult bit, there are some more things to mention about
the \ei{table} and \ei{figure} environments. Use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{caption}[short caption: o, full caption: m]
\end{lscommand}
command to define a caption for the float. A running number and
the string \enquote{Figure} or \enquote{Table} will be added by \LaTeX.

The two commands
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{listoffigures} and \csi{listoftables}
\end{lscommand}
operate analogously to the \csi{tableofcontents} command, printing a list of
figures or tables, respectively.  These lists will display the whole caption,
so if you tend to use long captions you must have a shorter version of the
caption for the lists. This is accomplished by entering the short version in
brackets after the \csi{caption} command.
\begin{code}
\mintinline{latex}|\caption[Short]{LLLLLoooooonnnnnggggg}|
\end{code}

Use \csi{label} and \csi{ref} to create a reference to a float within
your text. Note that the \csi{label} command must come \emph{after} the
\csi{caption} command since you want it to reference the number of the
caption. The \autoref{lst:floatrefs} presents an example usage of the described
commands.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{lined}{11cm}

Here is some text describing
the Figure~\ref{figure}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[
    scale=0.2
  ]{example-image}
  \caption[A figure]{An
    interesting figure}%
  \label{figure}
\end{figure}

\end{example}
  \end{lined}
  \caption{An example of using \ei{figure} float together with references and
    list of figures.}\label{lst:floatrefs}
\end{listing}

Under certain circumstances it might be necessary to use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{clearpage} or even the \csi{cleardoublepage}
\end{lscommand}
command. It orders \LaTeX{} to immediately place all floats remaining in the
queues and then start a new page. \csi{cleardoublepage} even goes to a new
right-hand page.

\subsection{Other Floats}

If you want to have other float lists than \enquote{Table} and \enquote{Figure}
use the \pai*{newfloat} package. It provides the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{DeclareFloatingEnvironment}[options: o, name: m]
\end{lscommand}
For example the \mintinline{latex}|\DeclareFloatingEnvironment{cat}| will
define a new environment \mintinline{latex}|cat| that can be used similarly to
\ei{figure} and \ei{table} environment and \mintinline{latex}|\listofcats| that
works analogously to \csi{listoftables}. You can customise the float using the
\carg{options} to change the printed captions (\cargv{name}), list title
(\cargv{listname}) or default placement (\cargv{placement}).

\subsection{The \ei{longtable} Environment}

Floating bodies occupy only a single page, thus putting \ei{longtable} into
them does not make sense. Still you may want to have the \ei{longtable} listed
in the list of tables with some caption. The \pai{longtable} package defines
its own \csi{caption} command that you may use inside the environment. Its use
is similar to the standard \csi{caption} command except that it is treated as a
row. If you pass empty optional argument to the \csi{caption} command it will
typeset normally but it won't be put in the list of tables, which is useful if
you want to have a running caption. See \autoref{lst:longrunningcaption} for an
example.

\section{Big Projects}
When working on big documents, you might want to split the input file
into several parts. \LaTeX{} has two commands that help you to do
that.

Use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{include}[filename: m]
\end{lscommand}
command in the document body to insert the contents of another file named
\emph{filename.tex}. Note that \LaTeX{} will start a new page before processing
the material input from \emph{filename.tex}.

The second command can be used in the preamble. It allows you to
instruct \LaTeX{} to only input some of the \mintinline{latex}|\include|d % chktex 27
files.
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{includeonly}[{{«\bs carg{filename}», «\bs carg{filename}», ...}}: c]
\end{lscommand}
After this command is executed in the preamble of the document, only
\csi{include} commands for the filenames that are listed in the
argument of the \csi{includeonly} command will be executed.

The \csi{include} command starts typesetting the included text on a new
page. This is helpful when you use \csi{includeonly}, because the
page breaks will not move, even when some include files are omitted.
Sometimes this might not be desirable. In this case, use the
\begin{lscommand}
  \csi{input}[filename: m]
\end{lscommand}
command. It simply includes the file specified.
No flashy suits, no strings attached.

To make \LaTeX{} quickly check your document use the \pai{syntonly}
package. This makes \LaTeX{} skim through your document only checking for
proper syntax and usage of the commands, but doesn't produce any (pdf) output.
As \LaTeX{} runs faster in this mode you may save yourself valuable time.
Usage is very simple:

\begin{minted}{latex}
  \usepackage{syntonly}
  \syntaxonly
\end{minted}
When you want to produce pages, just comment out the second line
(by adding a percent sign).
